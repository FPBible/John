<h1>Revelation 20</h1>
<h2>The End of the Old Order</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV20.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 20 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 19 displayed the decisive victory of the Lamb and the removal of beastly power.
Revelation 20 explains the aftermath in covenant terms:
the restriction of the adversary’s role, the vindication of faithful witnesses,
and the final judgment that closes the old covenant world.
This chapter must be read symbolically and contextually,
not as a literal timeline inserted after Christ’s reign.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Binding of the Adversary (20:1–3)</h3>
<p>
An angel descends with authority, restraining the adversary
and binding him for a defined period.
He is prevented from deceiving the nations as before,
until the appointed time is complete.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Reign of the Faithful Witnesses (20:4–6)</h3>
<p>
John sees thrones and those seated on them—
the faithful witnesses who refused beastly allegiance.
They share in life and reign with Christ.
This is called the first resurrection.
</p>
<p>
The second death has no authority over them.
They live and serve as priests of God and of Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Final Exposure and Judgment (20:7–10)</h3>
<p>
When the restraint is lifted, opposition briefly resurfaces.
Deception gathers resistance for a final exposure.
Fire from God ends the rebellion decisively.
</p>
<p>
The adversary is thrown into the lake of fire—
the same destiny as the beast and false prophet.
His role is finished.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Great White Throne (20:11–15)</h3>
<p>
A great throne appears.
The old heaven and earth flee—
the former covenant order has no standing.
</p>
<p>
The dead are judged according to what is written.
Death and Hades are thrown into the lake of fire.
This is the second death:
the complete removal of the old order and its power.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> Revelation 20 is not a prediction of a future millennium or final cosmic trial.
It symbolically describes the end of the old covenant world and the defeat of its accuser-role within the first-century transition.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Binding” means restriction of function, not non-existence</h3>
<p>
The adversary’s role as accuser and deceiver is curtailed.
He no longer defines covenant standing.
This aligns with the Gospel announcement that the ruler of this world was judged.
</p>

<h3>2) The “thousand years” is symbolic completeness</h3>
<p>
Revelation uses numbers symbolically.
The thousand-year reign represents the fullness and sufficiency of Christ’s reign,
not a literal future calendar period.
</p>

<h3>3) The first resurrection is covenant life, not bodily resuscitation</h3>
<p>
Those who reign are faithful witnesses.
Their resurrection is vindication and shared authority in Christ—
a present New Creation reality for those in Him.
</p>

<h3>4) The “release” exposes lingering resistance</h3>
<p>
Opposition briefly surfaces to demonstrate that rebellion has no future.
Its swift destruction confirms the finality of Christ’s victory.
</p>

<h3>5) The Great White Throne closes the old covenant account</h3>
<p>
Books imagery is courtroom language.
The judgment answers the martyr cry and removes death, Hades,
and all structures tied to the old age.
This prepares the way for the New Heaven and New Earth.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 20 declares that accusation, death, and condemnation
no longer govern God’s people.
New Creation life is lived beyond fear of judgment,
anchored in Christ’s finished victory and shared reign.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where do I still live as if accusation has authority?
What would change if I fully embraced that the old order is finished
and Christ’s reign defines my present reality?
</p>
