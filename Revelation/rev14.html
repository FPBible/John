<h1>Revelation 14</h1>
<h2>The Lamb, Allegiance, and the Harvest</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV14.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 14 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 13 exposed coercive allegiance demanded by beastly systems.
Revelation 14 provides contrast and clarity: who truly belongs to the Lamb,
what loyalty looks like under pressure, and how covenant judgment will fall.
This chapter reassures the faithful that false power is temporary
and that outcomes are already determined.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Lamb and the Marked People (14:1–5)</h3>
<p>
John sees the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with those who bear His name.
They are identified by allegiance, not fear.
They sing a new song that only the redeemed can learn.
</p>
<p>
Their faithfulness is described symbolically:
they have not compromised their loyalty,
they follow the Lamb wherever He goes,
and they are offered as firstfruits to God.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Three Angelic Proclamations (14:6–13)</h3>
<p>
A messenger announces the eternal gospel,
calling all to fear God and give Him glory,
because the hour of judgment has arrived.
</p>
<p>
Another announces the fall of Babylon—
the corrupt system that intoxicated the nations.
A third warns against allegiance to the beast,
declaring the consequences of such loyalty.
</p>
<p>
A blessing is pronounced on those who die in the Lord.
Their works follow them.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> These proclamations speak into the first-century covenant crisis,
announcing present judgment, not distant apocalypse.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Harvest of the Land (14:14–20)</h3>
<p>
One like a son of man appears with a sickle.
The time for harvest has come.
The land is reaped.
</p>
<p>
A second harvest follows—the grape harvest—
thrown into the winepress of God’s wrath.
The imagery depicts decisive covenant judgment,
not global annihilation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Mount Zion is covenant location, not geography lesson</h3>
<p>
Zion represents covenant authority and identity.
Standing with the Lamb on Zion declares who truly rules
and who truly belongs.
</p>

<h3>2) The 144,000 reappear as loyal witnesses</h3>
<p>
These are the sealed people from chapter 7,
now shown victorious and secure.
Their description emphasises allegiance,
not moral perfectionism.
</p>

<h3>3) “Eternal gospel” announces decisive moment</h3>
<p>
The gospel proclamation here includes judgment.
Good news and accountability arrive together.
This is not a delay but a declaration:
the covenant shift is happening.
</p>

<h3>4) Babylon’s fall is announced before it is shown</h3>
<p>
Revelation announces outcomes before detailing them.
Babylon’s fall is certain because its foundation is false.
The announcement comforts the faithful before the vision unfolds.
</p>

<h3>5) Harvest imagery signals completion</h3>
<p>
Harvest language consistently means readiness and conclusion.
The sickle falls when the time is full.
Revelation frames judgment as timely, not arbitrary.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 14 clarifies identity under pressure.
New Creation people are marked by allegiance to the Lamb,
not fear of beastly systems.
The harvest assures us that faithfulness is not forgotten
and false power does not endure.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
What voices compete for my allegiance?
Where do I need to remember that outcomes are already decided
and loyalty to the Lamb is never wasted?
