<h1>Revelation 5</h1>
<h2>The Lamb Is Worthy</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV05.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 5 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 4 established the throne: God reigns. Revelation 5 introduces the scroll and the question of worthiness.
The visions of judgment that follow are not random disasters; they are the outworking of the Lamb’s authority.
Before anything “unfolds,” the book shows why it unfolds: the crucified and risen Christ is worthy to open the scroll.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Sealed Scroll and the Crisis of Worthiness (5:1–4)</h3>
<p>
I saw in the right hand of the One on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
A mighty messenger proclaimed: “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
</p>
<p>
No one in heaven or on earth was found worthy, and I wept—because if the scroll remains sealed,
God’s covenant purposes remain unannounced and unexecuted.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Lion Who Appears as a Lamb (5:5–7)</h3>
<p>
One of the elders said, “Do not weep. The Lion from Judah, the Root of David, has conquered.
He can open the scroll and its seven seals.”
</p>
<p>
Then I saw, in the middle of the throne scene, a Lamb standing as slain—alive, yet marked by sacrifice.
He has seven horns and seven eyes—complete authority and complete insight, the Spirit in fullness sent into all the land.
</p>
<p>
He came and took the scroll from the One on the throne.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>New Song: Purchased People, Kingdom Priests (5:8–10)</h3>
<p>
When the Lamb took the scroll, the living creatures and elders fell down.
They held harps and bowls of incense—the prayers of the holy ones.
</p>
<p>
They sang a new song:
“You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals,
because you were slain, and by your blood you purchased people for God
from every tribe and language and people and nation.
You made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
and they reign on the earth.”
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Heaven’s Chorus: Worthy Is the Lamb (5:11–14)</h3>
<p>
Then I heard countless voices around the throne declaring:
“Worthy is the Lamb who was slain—power, riches, wisdom, strength, honour, glory, and blessing!”
</p>
<p>
All creation responded with worship to the One on the throne and to the Lamb.
The elders said “Amen,” and worship continued.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> The song says they “reign on the earth” as a present reality of New Covenant identity.
This is throne-room truth for first-century churches facing pressure, not a delayed kingdom awaiting a far-off age.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The scroll is covenant action, not a mystery novel</h3>
<p>
The scroll represents God’s decreed purposes being executed in history.
Revelation is showing that what follows (seals, trumpets, bowls) is not chaos—it is covenant administration.
The seals are not “end-times codes.” They are staged unveilings of judgment and transition under Christ’s authority.
</p>

<h3>2) Worthiness is moral: the Lamb opens judgment by sacrifice</h3>
<p>
No creature earns the right to open the scroll by strength. The Lamb is worthy because He was slain.
Revelation refuses the idea that judgment is God losing patience.
Judgment here is the righteous outworking of the cross and resurrection—vindication of the faithful and removal of the persecuting old order.
</p>

<h3>3) Lion and Lamb: conquest by faithful witness</h3>
<p>
John hears “Lion,” but sees “Lamb.” That contrast is deliberate.
The Messiah conquers not by brute force but by covenant faithfulness, suffering, and resurrection.
That is the model for the churches: overcoming is not domination; it is loyalty under cost.
</p>

<h3>4) Seven horns and seven eyes: complete authority and complete sight</h3>
<p>
In prophetic symbolism, horns represent power; eyes represent insight.
The Lamb has fullness of both. The churches are not being told to fear the empire or religious opposition.
They are being told: the Lamb sees everything and has authority over everything that is about to unfold.
</p>

<h3>5) “Purchased… kingdom and priests… reign on the earth” is New Covenant identity</h3>
<p>
This is Exodus-temple language carried into New Covenant reality.
A multi-ethnic people is gathered and constituted as God’s priestly kingdom.
The point is not future status. It is present covenant identity, lived under pressure as the old age collapses.
</p>

<h3>6) The prayers are inside the judgment narrative</h3>
<p>
The bowls of incense are the prayers of the holy ones. That means the coming judgments are not detached from suffering.
They are, in part, God’s answer to faithful cries for justice and vindication within the first-century crisis.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 5 says the centre of reality is not empire, fear, or collapse. It is the Lamb.
New Creation life flows from worship and allegiance to the crucified-and-risen King,
who sees clearly, rules truly, and opens history according to covenant righteousness.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I tempted to measure “power” by force, numbers, or control—when Revelation measures worthiness by the Lamb’s sacrifice?
What changes in my choices today if I live as part of a priestly kingdom that already belongs to the throne?
