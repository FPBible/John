<h1>Revelation 2</h1>
<h2>Christ Judges His Churches</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV02.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 2 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 1 revealed Christ walking among the lampstands. Revelation 2 applies that reality.
Before seals, trumpets, or bowls, the risen Lord addresses covenant faithfulness within His own people.
This chapter is not predictive speculation; it is present-tense judgment and correction for real first-century assemblies.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Ephesus — Faithful in Truth, Failing in Love (2:1–7)</h3>
<p>
The One who holds the messengers and walks among the lampstands knows the works, endurance, and discernment of Ephesus.
They have rejected false authority and endured pressure without quitting.
</p>
<p>
Yet they have abandoned their first love. They are commanded to remember, repent, and return.
If they refuse, their lampstand—their covenant role as light-bearer—will be removed.
To the overcomer is promised access to the tree of life in God’s paradise.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Smyrna — Faithful Under Pressure (2:8–11)</h3>
<p>
The First and the Last speaks to Smyrna, a church experiencing affliction and poverty,
yet declared rich by Christ. They face slander from religious opponents acting as adversaries.
</p>
<p>
They are warned of limited, defined testing, not endless suffering.
Faithfulness—even unto death—is met with the crown of life.
The overcomer is not harmed by the second death.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Pergamum — Holding Christ’s Name Where Pressure Is Strong (2:12–17)</h3>
<p>
Christ addresses Pergamum, a place of intense adversarial power.
They have held fast to His name even in persecution.
</p>
<p>
Yet compromise is tolerated: teaching that leads to idolatry and moral accommodation.
They are called to repent or face judgment by Christ’s word.
The overcomer receives hidden manna and a new covenant identity.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thyatira — Growing Works, Tolerated Corruption (2:18–29)</h3>
<p>
Thyatira is commended for love, faith, service, and increasing works.
But a corrupting influence—likened to “Jezebel”—is tolerated,
leading believers into idolatry and compromise.
</p>
<p>
Christ gives time for repentance. Refusal brings covenant judgment.
Those who remain faithful are promised shared authority and the morning star.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Revelation begins with judgment inside the covenant community</h3>
<p>
Before judging the persecuting order, Christ judges His own assemblies.
This establishes the book’s priority: loyalty, repentance, and endurance during covenant transition.
</p>

<h3>2) Lampstand removal is covenant discipline</h3>
<p>
The threat is not loss of personal salvation but loss of communal vocation.
A church that abandons covenant love forfeits its role as a faithful witness.
</p>

<h3>3) “Satan” language functions as adversary imagery</h3>
<p>
Religious opposition is described as adversarial, not metaphysical.
This is covenant conflict language rooted in first-century realities.
</p>

<h3>4) Compromise is framed as idolatry</h3>
<p>
The pressure to blend Christ with surrounding worship and economics
is treated as covenant betrayal, not cultural flexibility.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 2 shows that New Creation life is lived under Christ’s present authority.
Faithfulness matters. Love matters. Compromise is exposed.
The King walks among His people now.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I tempted to preserve comfort or reputation at the expense of covenant faithfulness—
and what would repentance look like in concrete action?
