<h1>Revelation 6</h1>
<h2>The Seals: Covenant Upheaval Begins</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV06.htm" target="_blank">Revelation 6 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Revelation 4–5 established the throne and the Lamb’s worthiness. Revelation 6 begins the opening of the scroll.
What follows is not random disaster or end-of-the-world imagery; it is the covenant outworking of the Lamb’s authority
within the first-century horizon. The seals reveal escalating pressure as the old persecuting order destabilises.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The First Four Seals: Conquest, Conflict, Scarcity, Death (6:1–8)</h3>
<p>
As the Lamb opens the seals, four horsemen are released in sequence.
They represent conquering power, civil conflict, economic scarcity, and death spreading across the land.
The imagery is symbolic, portraying societal breakdown rather than literal riders.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Fifth Seal: The Cry of the Faithful (6:9–11)</h3>
<p>
Under the altar are the lives of those who were slain because of God’s word and faithful witness.
They cry out for justice—not revenge, but vindication.
They are told to rest a little longer until the appointed measure is complete.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Sixth Seal: Covenant Collapse Imagery (6:12–17)</h3>
<p>
A great shaking follows: earth trembles, the sun darkens, the moon turns red,
stars fall, and rulers hide in fear.
These images describe the collapse of covenant authority and power,
not the destruction of the physical universe.
</p>
<p>
Those responsible for oppression recognise the arrival of judgment:
the day of the Lamb’s wrath has come, and no false shelter can stand.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Zero futurism:</strong> Cosmic language here follows prophetic convention.
It describes covenant and political collapse within history, not a future end-of-creation scenario.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The horsemen are covenant judgments, not global apocalypse</h3>
<p>
The four horsemen echo Old Testament judgment patterns (conquest, sword, famine, death).
They symbolise progressive instability as the old order resists the Lamb’s reign.
This is covenant discipline unfolding in the first-century land.
</p>

<h3>2) Martyr cries are covenant appeals for vindication</h3>
<p>
The faithful dead appeal to God’s justice because covenant promises are at stake.
Their request is not ignored, but timed.
The delay shows restraint and purpose, not absence.
</p>

<h3>3) “How long?” signals nearness, not delay into distant ages</h3>
<p>
Biblical “how long” language presumes resolution within the covenant timeframe.
The answer—“a little longer”—confirms Revelation’s near-horizon emphasis.
</p>

<h3>4) Cosmic collapse imagery is prophetic shorthand</h3>
<p>
Darkened sun, falling stars, and shaking earth appear throughout the prophets
to describe the fall of ruling powers and covenant systems.
Revelation uses the same language to announce the end of the persecuting order.
</p>

<h3>5) Wrath is covenant judgment, not eternal torment</h3>
<p>
“The wrath of the Lamb” is judicial action against those opposing His reign.
It is historical, targeted, and covenantal—answering the cries of the faithful.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Revelation 6 assures believers that suffering is seen, heard, and measured.
History is not spiralling; it is being opened by the Lamb.
New Creation people endure with confidence that covenant justice is real and purposeful.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
When pressure rises and systems shake, where do I look for security—
and how does trusting the Lamb’s authority change my response today?
