<h1>Philippians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1 — Life in Christ, Now</h2>

<p><em>
Philippians is written from within fulfilled reality.
Paul is not preparing believers for a future kingdom,
but teaching them how to live from a present one.
</em></p>

<h3>Grace, Peace, and Partnership</h3>

<p>
Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,
to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi,
with the overseers and servants:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
I thank my God every time I remember you,
always praying with joy for all of you,
because of your partnership in the good news
from the first day until now.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:3–5)</a>
</p>

<p>
I am confident of this:
that the One who began a good work among you
will carry it through to completion,
bringing it to its full expression
within the day of Christ Jesus.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>Love Grounded in Discernment</h3>

<p>
It is right for me to think this way about you all,
because I hold you in my heart —
both in my imprisonment
and in the defence and confirmation of the good news,
you all share with me in grace.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:7)</a>
</p>

<p>
This is my prayer:
that your love may overflow more and more
with knowledge and discernment,
so that you may approve what truly matters,
and live as a sincere and blameless people,
filled with the fruit of righteousness
that comes through Jesus Christ,
to the glory and praise of God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:9–11)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Gospel Advances Through Resistance</h3>

<p>
I want you to know, brothers and sisters,
that what has happened to me
has actually served to advance the good news.
My imprisonment has made it clear throughout the whole guard
and to everyone else
that I am in chains for Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:12–13)</a>
</p>

<p>
Most of the brothers and sisters,
having gained confidence in the Lord through my chains,
dare all the more to speak the word fearlessly.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:14)</a>
</p>

<p>
Some proclaim Christ from envy and rivalry,
others from goodwill.
The latter do so from love,
knowing I am appointed for the defence of the good news.
The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition,
not sincerely, hoping to cause me trouble.
But what does it matter?
In every way — whether from false motives or true —
Christ is proclaimed.
And in this I rejoice.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:15–18)</a>
</p>

<h3>Christ Magnified in Life or Death</h3>

<p>
Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
for I know that through your prayers
and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
this will turn out for my deliverance.
My eager expectation and hope
is that I will not be put to shame in any way,
but that with full courage,
now as always,
Christ will be magnified in my body,
whether by life or by death.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:18–20)</a>
</p>

<p>
For to me, to live is Christ,
and to die is gain.
If I am to go on living in the body,
this means fruitful work.
Yet what I shall choose I do not know.
I am pulled in two directions:
I desire to depart and be with Christ,
which is far better;
but it is more necessary for you
that I remain here for your sake.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:21–24)</a>
</p>

<p>
Convinced of this,
I know that I will remain
and continue with all of you
for your progress and joy in the faith,
so that your confidence in Christ Jesus
may overflow because of me.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:25–26)</a>
</p>

<h3>Living Worthy of the Good News</h3>

<p>
Only this:
live as citizens worthy of the good news of Christ.
Whether I come and see you or remain absent,
may I hear that you are standing firm in one spirit,
striving together with one soul
for the faithfulness of the good news,
without being intimidated by opponents.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:27–28)</a>
</p>

<p>
This courage is a sign to them of their collapse,
but of your deliverance —
and this is from God.
For it has been granted to you,
on behalf of Christ,
not only to trust in Him,
but also to suffer for Him,
since you are engaged in the same struggle
you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:28–30)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Philippians 1</h2>

<h3>1) “Completion” refers to covenant fulfilment, not delayed salvation</h3>
<p>
Paul’s confidence is not abstract.
The “good work” reaches its full expression
as the old covenant order gives way
to the publicly established reign of Christ.
This is not suspense — it is historical assurance.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Life and death are not opposites — Christ is central to both</h3>
<p>
Paul does not treat death as an enemy that postpones hope.
Whether alive or dead,
his existence is oriented around Christ.
This is settled identity, not anxious expectation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:21)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Citizenship is allegiance, not geography</h3>
<p>
To “live as citizens” means to embody loyalty and values now.
Heaven is the source of authority,
not the destination of escape.
The community already lives under Christ’s rule.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP01.htm">(Phil 1:27)</a>
</p>

<p>
Philippians 1 establishes the tone of the whole letter:
joy without denial,
confidence without triumphalism,
and life lived consciously within fulfilled reality.
