<h1>Philippians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3 — True Righteousness and Present Citizenship</h2>

<p><em>
Philippians 3 dismantles confidence in the old covenant system
and redefines righteousness, resurrection, and citizenship
from the perspective of fulfilled life in Christ.
</em></p>

<h3>No Confidence in the Flesh</h3>

<p>
Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord.
To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me,
and it is a safeguard for you.
Watch out for the dogs,
watch out for the evil workers,
watch out for those who mutilate the flesh.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
For we are the circumcision —
those who worship by the Spirit of God,
boast in Christ Jesus,
and put no confidence in the flesh.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:3)</a>
</p>

<h3>Old Covenant Credentials Abandoned</h3>

<p>
If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh,
I have more:
circumcised on the eighth day,
of the people of Israel,
of the tribe of Benjamin,
a Hebrew of Hebrews;
as to the law, a Pharisee;
as to zeal, a persecutor of the assembly;
as to righteousness under the law, blameless.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:4–6)</a>
</p>

<p>
But whatever gain I had,
I have counted as loss because of Christ.
More than that,
I count everything as loss
because of the surpassing worth
of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things
and count them as refuse,
so that I may gain Christ
and be found in Him —
not having a righteousness of my own from the law,
but one that comes through the faithfulness of Christ,
the righteousness from God
that rests on trust.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:7–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>Knowing Christ and Resurrection Life</h3>

<p>
My aim is to know Him —
to live from the power of His resurrection,
to share in His sufferings,
to be shaped into His self-giving death,
so that I may fully participate
in the resurrection-life that stands out from among the dead.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:10–11)</a>
</p>

<strong>Clarification — “Resurrection from the Dead”</strong><br />
Paul is not chasing a delayed future event.
He is pressing into lived participation in resurrection life —
life out from among the old covenant deadness and condemnation.
This is covenantal resurrection language: new life, new status, new humanity in Christ.
</div>

<h3>Pressing On into Full Maturity</h3>

<p>
Not that I have already taken hold of it
or have already been brought to full maturity,
but I press on
to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
Brothers and sisters,
I do not consider that I have made it my own.
But one thing I do:
forgetting what lies behind
and reaching forward to what lies ahead,
I pursue the goal
for the prize of God’s upward call in Christ Jesus.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:12–14)</a>
</p>

<p>
Let those of us who are mature think this way;
and if in anything you think differently,
God will reveal this also to you.
Only let us hold true
to what we have already attained.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:15–16)</a>
</p>

<h3>Two Ways of Walking</h3>

<p>
Join in imitating me,
and keep your eyes on those
who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
For many walk — as I have often told you,
and now tell you even with tears —
as enemies of the cross of Christ.
Their end is destruction,
their god is their appetite,
their glory is in their shame,
their minds are set on earthly things.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:17–19)</a>
</p>

<h3>Citizenship Defined</h3>

<p>
But our citizenship is in heaven —
meaning our authority, identity, and allegiance come from above,
not from the old earth-bound system.
From there we look to the Lord Jesus Christ
as the present reigning King —
the One whose rule comes from heaven
and is lived out on earth —
who re-forms our lowly embodied life
to match His glorified life,
by the power that enables Him
to bring all things into subjection to Himself.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:20–21)</a>
</p>

">
<strong>Clarification — “From Heaven We Look to the Lord”</strong><br />
Paul is not telling believers to wait for Jesus to travel down from the sky.
“Heaven” is the seat of authority, and Jesus already reigns from there.
“Coming” language is royal and covenantal: His rule and verdict arrive,
His authority is publicly enacted, and His people live under that reign now.
This is not postponed hope — it is present allegiance.

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Philippians 3</h2>

<h3>1) Paul doesn’t “balance” the old system — he discards it</h3>
<p>
This isn’t moderate reform.
It’s total revaluation.
The law-based identity system can’t be “improved” —
it’s replaced by Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:7–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Resurrection is participation, not postponement</h3>
<p>
Paul’s pursuit is lived alignment with resurrection power now revealed in Christ.
The deadness of condemnation and separation is behind him.
He is describing the shape of New Creation life.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:10–11)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) “Pressing on” is maturity within what has already been attained</h3>
<p>
Paul explicitly says, “hold true to what we have already attained.”
That destroys the futurist reading.
He isn’t chasing a kingdom that hasn’t arrived —
he’s pursuing coherence with the one already established.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:12–16)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Heaven is the throne-room, not the escape hatch</h3>
<p>
Citizenship “in heaven” means the believer’s authority-source is above,
because Christ reigns above.
The church lives on earth as the embodied outworking of that reign.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP03.htm">(Phil 3:20)</a>
</p>

<p>
Philippians 3 is a clean break:
old covenant confidence discarded,
new covenant righteousness received,
resurrection life embodied,
and allegiance anchored in Christ’s present reign.
