<h1>Romans 1</h1>
<h2>Gospel Power and Covenant Accountability</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Gospel Announced (Romans 1:1–17)</h2>

<p><strong>1:1–4</strong> Paul, a servant of Jesus the Messiah, called as an apostle and set apart for God’s good news. This gospel was promised beforehand through the prophets in the holy writings. It concerns God’s Son — descended from David according to the flesh, and powerfully declared Son of God by resurrection, by the Spirit of holiness: Jesus the Messiah, our Lord.</p>

<p><strong>1:5–7</strong> Through Him we received grace and apostleship to bring the obedience that comes from faith among all the nations for His name’s sake. You too are among those called by Jesus the Messiah. To all who are in Rome, loved by God and called as holy ones: grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah.</p>

<p><strong>1:8–12</strong> First, I thank my God through Jesus the Messiah for you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the world. God is my witness — whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son — how unceasingly I mention you, always asking that I might at last succeed in coming to you by God’s will. I long to see you so I may share something strengthening with you, so that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.</p>

<p><strong>1:13–15</strong> I do not want you unaware, brothers and sisters, that I have often planned to come to you (but have been prevented until now), so that I might have some fruit among you also, as among the rest of the nations. I am under obligation both to Greeks and to non-Greeks, to the wise and to the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel also to you in Rome.</p>

<p><strong>1:16–17</strong> For I am not ashamed of the gospel. It is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes — to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it God’s righteousness is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”</p>

<h2>Paraphrase — Truth Suppressed and the Wrath Revealed (Romans 1:18–32)</h2>

<p><strong>1:18–20</strong> For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of people who suppress the truth by their injustice — because what can be known about God is evident among them. God has made it plain: His invisible attributes, eternal power, and divine nature have been clearly seen through what He has made, leaving them without excuse.</p>

<p><strong>1:21–23</strong> Though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or give thanks. Their thinking became empty and their hearts darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal humanity, birds, animals, and creeping things.</p>

<p><strong>1:24–27</strong> Therefore God gave them over to the desires they insisted on — to impurity, to dishonoring their bodies. They exchanged God’s truth for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions. Their desires became disordered, and they abandoned what is natural in exchange for what is contrary to their created intent.</p>

<p><strong>1:28–32</strong> Since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a debased mind to do what is not fitting. They were filled with every kind of injustice, evil, greed, and malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and spite; gossipers, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, boastful; inventors of evil; disobedient to parents; senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. They know God’s just decree — that those who practice such things deserve death — yet they not only do them but applaud others who practice them.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans is written into a real first-century problem: how do Jews and Gentiles belong together in Messiah without the old identity markers
(circumcision, food laws, temple boundaries) governing the definition of “God’s people”?
Paul is building a covenant-level case for a new humanity in Christ.
</p>

<p>
Romans 1 is the opening hammer: the world is not morally “fine,” and Israel is not automatically safe by possessing the Law.
Paul begins with the nations’ idolatry and corruption to establish a shared need for rescue —
then he will turn the argument toward Jewish covenant confidence in Romans 2.
</p>

<p>
So “wrath” here is not random divine rage. It’s covenant consequence and revealed judgment within history,
aimed at clearing the ground for the Gospel’s announcement: righteousness is revealed in Christ apart from Law.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) The Gospel is not advice — it is power</h3>
<p>
Paul opens with announcement, not suggestion. The gospel is “power” because it creates a new standing and a new identity.
It does not merely tell people what to do; it declares what God has done in the Son and brings people into that reality.
This is why Paul ties the gospel to the prophets and to Davidic kingship: the promised covenant story has reached its climax in Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) “Righteousness of God” is covenant faithfulness revealed in Christ</h3>
<p>
Paul is not saying God finally starts being righteous. He is saying God’s covenant faithfulness is now unveiled:
God keeps His promises, fulfills His purposes, and creates a right-standing people through Messiah.
That right-standing is received by faith — not produced by Law-performance and not restricted by ethnic boundary.
</p>

<h3>3) “Wrath revealed” includes God giving people over</h3>
<p>
Notice how “wrath” operates in Romans 1: God “gave them over.”
That is judgment in the form of consequence — the unmaking that follows idolatry.
This is not a later, other-world torture threat. It is visible collapse within history: worship distortion produces human distortion.
Paul is describing a world that has rejected the Creator and is reaping the internal breakdown that follows.
</p>

<h3>4) Romans 1 is not a weapon — it is a setup</h3>
<p>
People often use Romans 1 as a club to condemn “those people out there.”
Paul’s next move is to turn the mirror: the moralizer is also guilty (Romans 2).
His goal is not to create two classes (good people vs bad people).
His goal is to shut every mouth and establish that the whole world needs the same rescue.
</p>

<h3>5) “They knew God” is about accountability, not enlightenment</h3>
<p>
Paul says they had enough light to be accountable: creation testifies, conscience testifies, and history testifies.
This is not “nature worship is fine.” It is the opposite: the created world points beyond itself.
When the sign is worshiped instead of the Giver, humanity bends inward and fractures.
</p>

<h3>6) Covenant transition is coming into view</h3>
<p>
Paul is about to argue that possession of Torah does not protect Israel from judgment if the covenant is violated.
That’s why “wrath” matters in Romans: it belongs to the covenant lawsuit background.
The old order is under judgment, and the new order is being revealed.
Romans is not saying “wait for salvation later.” It is declaring salvation now — in Messiah — for Jew and Gentile together.

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 1 does not exist to make you afraid. It exists to make the Gospel clear.
When humanity worships the wrong thing, it becomes the wrong thing — fractured, anxious, accusatory, enslaved to desire.
But the Gospel is God’s power to rescue, rebuild, and re-humanise.
</p>

<p>
The New Creation begins where idolatry ends: in the recognition that Christ is Lord,
and that righteousness is received, not earned.
This produces humility (no moral superiority), clarity (truth matters), and freedom (no condemnation-based identity).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where have I been treating something created (approval, control, pleasure, success, religion, politics) as ultimate —
and what would change if Christ truly became the centre of my worship and identity today?
