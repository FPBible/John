<h1>Romans 6</h1>
<h2>Dead to the Old World, Alive in the New</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Romans 6 answers a misunderstanding created by grace.
If righteousness is given apart from the Law,
does that mean sin no longer matters?
</p>

<p>
Paul’s answer is not moral panic.
It is identity.
Believers no longer belong to the world
where sin and death ruled.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Grace Does Not Leave You Where You Were (6:1–7)</h3>

<p>
What then should we say?
Should we remain in sin
so that grace increases?
</p>

<p>
Absolutely not.
We died to sin.
How could we still live in it?
</p>

<p>
Do you not know
that all who were immersed into Christ Jesus
were immersed into His death?
</p>

<p>
We were buried with Him through immersion into death,
so that,
just as Christ was raised from the dead
through the glory of the Father,
we now walked in newness of life.
</p>

<p>
If we have been united with Him
in the likeness of His death,
we have also been united with Him
in the likeness of His risen life.
</p>

<p>
Our old person was crucified with Him,
so that the body ruled by sin
was rendered powerless,
so that we were no longer enslaved to sin.
</p>

<p>
The one who has died
has been released from sin’s authority.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
This death and resurrection describe covenant transition,
not future biology or repeated experiences.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Alive to God Now (6:8–14)</h3>

<p>
Since we died with Christ,
we trust that we also live with Him.
</p>

<p>
We know that Christ,
having been raised from the dead,
no longer dies.
Death no longer has authority over Him.
</p>

<p>
The death He died,
He died to sin once for all;
the life He lives,
He lives to God.
</p>

<p>
In the same way,
you are to count yourselves
dead to sin
and alive to God
in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Therefore,
do not allow sin
to rule in your mortal existence
so that you obey its desires.
</p>

<p>
Do not present yourselves to sin
as instruments of injustice,
but present yourselves to God
as those who are alive from the dead.
</p>

<p>
Sin does not rule over you,
because you are not under Law
but under grace.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Paul does not say sin will stop ruling someday.
He declares that its rule has already ended.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>From One Master to Another (6:15–19)</h3>

<p>
What then?
Should we sin because we are not under Law,
but under grace?
Absolutely not.
</p>

<p>
You were slaves of the power you obeyed —
either sin leading to death,
or obedience leading to righteousness.
</p>

<p>
But thanks be to God,
though you once served sin,
you became obedient from the heart
to the pattern of teaching
to which you were entrusted.
</p>

<p>
Having been freed from sin,
you were enslaved to righteousness.
</p>

<p>
Just as you once presented yourselves
as slaves to impurity and lawlessness,
so now you present yourselves
as slaves to righteousness,
leading to holiness.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Slavery language describes covenant allegiance,
not ongoing self-improvement projects.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Two Outcomes, One Already Ended (6:20–23)</h3>

<p>
When you were slaves of sin,
you were free from righteousness.
</p>

<p>
What benefit did you gain
from the things
you are now ashamed of?
</p>

<p>
Those things resulted in death.
</p>

<p>
But now,
having been freed from sin
and enslaved to God,
you have your fruit leading to holiness,
and the outcome is covenant life.
</p>

<p>
For the wages of sin was death,
but the gift of God
is covenant life
in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
“Death” and “life” describe two covenant realms.
The old realm has ended;
the new is established.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Romans 6 is about identity, not effort</h3>
<p>
Paul does not command believers
to die to sin.
He declares that they already have.
</p>

<h3>2) Baptism marks transition, not repetition</h3>
<p>
Immersion signifies passage
from the old covenant world
into the New Creation world.
</p>

<h3>3) Sin loses authority when Law ends</h3>
<p>
Sin’s power was tied to the Law’s jurisdiction.
With the Law fulfilled and removed,
sin no longer reigns.
</p>

<h3>4) Obedience flows from belonging</h3>
<p>
Righteous living emerges
because identity has changed,
not to make the change happen.
</p>

    <strong>Death defeated covenantally</strong> —

    <strong>End of the old covenant world</strong> —

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Freedom is not the absence of struggle.
</p>

<p>
Freedom is knowing
which world you belong to.
</p>

<p>
Believers do not fight sin
to become alive.
They live alive
because sin’s authority has already ended.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where might I still think of myself
as someone trying to die,
instead of someone who already lives?
