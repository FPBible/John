<h1>Romans 3</h1>
<h2>Justification Revealed, the Law Silenced</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ROM03.htm" target="_blank">
Romans 3 — WEB
</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Romans 3 concludes Paul’s exposure of every covenant advantage
that once defined righteousness.
Pagans, moralists, and Torah-possessors
have all been shown equally accountable.
</p>

<p>
This chapter does not ask how people might be justified one day.
It announces how justification has already been revealed
apart from the Law,
within Paul’s generation,
through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Law’s Advantage — and Its Limit (3:1–8)</h3>

<p>
What advantage, then, did the Jew have?
What value was there in circumcision?
</p>

<p>
There was real value —
they were entrusted with the words of God.
</p>

<p>
But the unfaithfulness of some
did not cancel God’s faithfulness.
</p>

<p>
Let God be proven true,
even if every human system is shown false.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Paul defends God’s covenant faithfulness
even as the covenant system itself
is being brought to its end.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Whole World Accountable (3:9–20)</h3>

<p>
So what follows?
Are we better off?
Not at all.
</p>

<p>
We have already charged
that Jews and Gentiles alike
were under sin.
</p>

<p>
As it is written:
“There is no one righteous —
not even one.”
</p>

<p>
No human being was justified before God
by works of the Law,
because the Law’s function
was to expose sin,
not to remove it.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
The Law’s voice is now silenced.
Its testimony has done its work
and has reached its conclusion.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Righteousness Now Revealed Apart from the Law (3:21–26)</h3>

<p>
But now —
apart from the Law —
the righteousness of God
has been revealed,
</p>

<p>
attested by the Law and the Prophets,
</p>

<p>
the righteousness that comes
through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ
for all who believe.
</p>

<p>
There was no distinction:
all sinned
and fell short of God’s glory,
</p>

<p>
and all were now being justified freely
by His grace,
through the redemption
accomplished in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
God publicly presented Him
as the mercy seat,
through His blood,
demonstrating His righteousness,
</p>

<p>
because He had passed over former sins
during the time of forbearance,
</p>

<p>
in order to show His righteousness
in the present time —
that He is just
and the one who justifies
those who belong to Jesus.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
“Now” means now.
Justification is not deferred.
It is the present covenant verdict
announced in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Boasting Ended, the Law Fulfilled (3:27–31)</h3>

<p>
Where, then, was boasting?
It was excluded.
</p>

<p>
Not by works,
but by a principle of faith.
</p>

<p>
A person is justified
apart from works of the Law.
</p>

<p>
Is God the God of Jews only?
Is He not also the God of Gentiles?
Yes — of Gentiles also.
</p>

<p>
There is one God,
who justified the circumcised by faith
and the uncircumcised through faith.
</p>

<p>
Do we then overthrow the Law by faith?
Absolutely not.
</p>

<p>
We fulfilled it.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
The Law is not revived.
It is completed.
Faith establishes its intended goal
by ending its condemning function.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “But now” marks the covenant turning point</h3>
<p>
This phrase is not poetic.
It signals a decisive historical shift:
the Law’s era has closed,
and righteousness has been unveiled in Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) Justification is a present verdict</h3>
<p>
Justification is not a future acquittal.
It is God’s declaration,
in history,
that those in Christ
stand righteous apart from Torah.
</p>

<h3>3) The mercy seat replaces the temple</h3>
<p>
Paul declares Jesus
as the new place of atonement.
This directly undermines
the ongoing authority of the temple system.
</p>

<h3>4) Faith fulfills what the Law could not</h3>
<p>
Faith does not add obedience to the Law.
It brings the Law’s role to completion
by ending its power to accuse.
</p>

<h2>Prophecy Hub Connections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Righteousness revealed in the last days of the covenant</strong> —
    <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/isaiah.html">Isaiah</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Atonement completed</strong> —
    <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/hebrews.html">Hebrews</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Righteousness is not earned,
maintained,
or awaited.
</p>

<p>
It has been revealed.
It has been given.
It has been declared.
</p>

<p>
Life in Christ begins
from a settled verdict,
not from fear of judgment.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
If justification is already declared,
where might I still live
as though I must prove myself?
</p>
