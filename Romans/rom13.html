<h1>Romans 13</h1>
<h2>Authority, Love, and the End of the Night</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Governing Authorities (Romans 13:1–7)</h2>

<p><strong>13:1–2</strong> Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist have been established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority resists what God has ordered, and those who resist will incur judgment.</p>

<p><strong>13:3–4</strong> Rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will receive approval, for it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid — for it does not bear the sword in vain. It is God’s servant, an avenger who carries out wrath on the wrongdoer.</p>

<p><strong>13:5–7</strong> Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience’ sake. This is why you also pay taxes — for the authorities are God’s servants, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue, respect to whom respect, honour to whom honour.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Love Fulfills the Law (Romans 13:8–10)</h2>

<p><strong>13:8</strong> Owe no one anything, except to love one another — for the one who loves another has fulfilled the Law.</p>

<p><strong>13:9–10</strong> The commandments are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” Love does no harm to a neighbour; therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Night Is Ending (Romans 13:11–14)</h2>

<p><strong>13:11–12</strong> And do this, knowing the time — that the hour has already come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.</p>

<p><strong>13:13–14</strong> Let us walk properly as in the daytime — not in debauchery and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 13 continues Paul’s description of New Creation life in public space.
Believers are learning how to live faithfully within the structures of the world
while no longer belonging to the old covenant order.
</p>

<p>
This is not blind obedience theology.
It is practical wisdom for a people living between covenant worlds
during a time of imminent historical transition.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant & Historical Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) “Authorities” are contextual, not absolute</h3>
<p>
Paul writes to believers living under Roman rule.
Submission here is pragmatic and peace-oriented,
not a declaration that all authorities always act righteously.
Scripture itself records faithful resistance when authorities oppose God.
</p>

<h3>2) God uses civil authority to restrain chaos</h3>
<p>
Paul affirms the basic function of governing structures:
they restrain violence and maintain order.
This is not covenant salvation — it is social stability.
</p>

<h3>3) “Wrath” here is civil, not eternal</h3>
<p>
The sword belongs to civil justice.
Paul is not describing hell or final judgment,
but the real-world consequences of criminal behaviour.
</p>

<h3>4) Love replaces Law as the governing ethic</h3>
<p>
Paul immediately reframes obedience.
The ultimate obligation is not legal compliance but love.
Love fulfills what the Law aimed at without enforcing it through fear.
</p>

<h3>5) “The night is far gone” is time-sensitive language</h3>
<p>
Paul is not speaking metaphorically about personal growth.
He is announcing an approaching historical dawn.
The old covenant night is ending;
the New Creation day is arriving.
</p>

<h3>6) “Put on Christ” is identity language</h3>
<p>
This is not moral effort alone.
It is living out who believers already are.
Christ defines behaviour because Christ defines identity.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 13 teaches believers how to live calmly and honourably
in a world still governed by imperfect systems.
You are not called to fear authority —
you are called to outgrow fear through love.
</p>

<p>
The day has arrived.
Live like it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be reacting in fear or defiance
instead of responding from love and trust in God’s governance?
