<h1>Romans 4</h1>
<h2>Abraham Fulfilled, Promise Realised</h2>

<p class="note">

Romans 4 — WEB
</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Romans 4 explains how righteousness apart from the Law
was always God’s intention.
Paul does not introduce a new method of salvation.
He shows that the covenant shift now revealed in Christ
was anticipated in Abraham himself.
</p>

<p>
This chapter is not about abstract faith.
It is about covenant inheritance
reaching its appointed fulfillment.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Abraham Counted Righteous Before the Law (4:1–8)</h3>

<p>
What then shall we say about Abraham,
the forefather of Israel according to the flesh?
</p>

<p>
If Abraham had been justified by works,
he would have had something to boast about —
but not before God.
</p>

<p>
For what did the Scripture say?
“Abraham believed God,
and it was counted to him as righteousness.”
</p>

<p>
Now wages are not credited as a gift,
but as something owed.
</p>

<p>
But to the one who does not work
yet trusts the God who justifies the ungodly,
faith was counted as righteousness.
</p>

<p>
David spoke of this same blessing,
describing the person
whose lawless deeds were forgiven
and whose sins were covered.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Righteousness is credited apart from Law,
and this principle was already active
before Sinai existed.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Before Circumcision, Before Boundary (4:9–12)</h3>

<p>
Was this blessing only for the circumcised?
Or also for the uncircumcised?
</p>

<p>
Faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness
before he was circumcised.
</p>

<p>
Circumcision was later given
as a sign and seal
of the righteousness he already possessed by faith.
</p>

<p>
This made Abraham
the father of all who believe —
both the uncircumcised who believe
and the circumcised who do not rely on the Law.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Circumcision never created covenant righteousness.
It marked a role now fulfilled and surpassed in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Promise Fulfilled Apart from the Law (4:13–17)</h3>

<p>
The promise to Abraham
that he would inherit the world
did not come through the Law,
but through the righteousness of faith.
</p>

<p>
If inheritance depended on the Law,
faith would be emptied
and the promise nullified.
</p>

<p>
The Law produced transgression,
because where the Law existed,
violation followed.
</p>

<p>
For this reason,
the promise rested on grace,
so that it would be guaranteed
to all Abraham’s offspring —
not only those under the Law,
but those who shared Abraham’s faith.
</p>

<p>
As it is written:
“I have made you a father of many nations.”
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
“Inherit the world” refers to covenant authority and inclusion,
now realised through Christ,
not a postponed global possession.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Life Out of Death — Then and Now (4:18–22)</h3>

<p>
Against human expectation,
Abraham trusted in God
and became the father of many nations,
just as it had been spoken.
</p>

<p>
He did not deny the reality
of his own lifeless body
or Sarah’s barrenness,
</p>

<p>
yet he did not waver in unbelief,
but was strengthened in faith,
giving glory to God.
</p>

<p>
He was fully convinced
that God was able to do
what He had promised.
</p>

<p>
That is why
his faith was counted as righteousness.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Abraham’s story foreshadows covenant resurrection —
life emerging where the Law could not produce it.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Promise Completed in Christ (4:23–25)</h3>

<p>
These words —
“it was counted to him” —
were not written for Abraham alone,
</p>

<p>
but for us as well,
to whom righteousness was credited,
</p>

<p>
because we trusted the God
who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
</p>

<p>
He was handed over because of transgressions
and raised to establish our justification.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Justification is not pending.
The resurrection publicly confirmed
the righteous status now shared by those in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Abraham proves righteousness predates the Law</h3>
<p>
Paul uses Abraham
to dismantle the idea
that covenant standing was ever earned by obedience.
</p>

<h3>2) “Inheriting the world” is covenantal</h3>
<p>
This promise speaks of scope,
not geography —
the expansion of God’s family beyond Israel.
</p>

<h3>3) Resurrection language is corporate</h3>
<p>
Life from death
describes the emergence of a new covenant people,
not a delayed biological event.
</p>

<h3>4) Christ completes the Abrahamic promise</h3>
<p>
The resurrection marks the public moment
when righteousness was confirmed
apart from the Law for all who believe.
</p>

<h2>Prophecy Hub Connections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Promise to the nations fulfilled</strong> —
    <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/isaiah.html">Isaiah</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resurrection as covenant life</strong> —
    <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/resurrection/1cor15.html">1 Corinthians 15</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Faith is not waiting.
It is participation.
</p>

<p>
Abraham’s promise is no longer anticipated.
It is realised in a people
formed by the Spirit,
not by Law or lineage.
</p>

<p>
Believers live
from a completed promise,
not toward an uncertain future.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where might I still treat God’s promise
as something to earn or wait for,
instead of something already given in Christ?
