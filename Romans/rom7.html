</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Romans 7 explains why sin no longer rules
over those in Christ.
The answer is not improved willpower.
It is the termination of the Law’s authority.
</p>

<p>
This chapter does not describe a believer’s ongoing inner battle.
It describes the experience of Israel
living under the Law as the covenant age came to its end.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Death Ends Legal Authority (7:1–6)</h3>

<p>
Do you not know,
brothers and sisters —
for I speak to those who know the Law —
that the Law had authority over a person
only as long as that person lived?
</p>

<p>
A married woman was bound by law to her husband
while he lived.
But if the husband died,
she was released from the law of marriage.
</p>

<p>
So then,
if she belonged to another man
while her husband lived,
she was called an adulteress.
But if the husband died,
she was free from that law.
</p>

<p>
In the same way,
you died to the Law
through the body of Christ,
so that you might belong to another —
to Him who was raised from the dead —
in order that we might bear fruit for God.
</p>

<p>
While we lived under the old order,
sinful passions stirred up by the Law
were at work in our members,
producing fruit for death.
</p>

<p>
But now,
we have been released from the Law,
having died to what held us,
so that we serve in newness of the Spirit
and not in oldness of written code.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Release from the Law is not progressive.
It is complete.
The marriage ended when the covenant died.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Law’s Role Revealed (7:7–13)</h3>

<p>
What then shall we say?
Was the Law sin?
Absolutely not.
</p>

<p>
Yet I would not have known sin
except through the Law.
</p>

<p>
I would not have known coveting
if the Law had not said,
“You shall not covet.”
</p>

<p>
Sin seized opportunity through the commandment
and produced every kind of coveting.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the Law,
sin lay dormant.
</p>

<p>
I was once alive apart from the Law,
but when the commandment came,
sin sprang to life,
and I died.
</p>

<p>
The commandment,
which was meant for life,
was found to result in death.
</p>

<p>
Sin,
seizing opportunity through the commandment,
deceived and killed through it.
</p>

<p>
So the Law was holy,
and the commandment holy,
righteous,
and good.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
The Law was not the problem.
Its function was temporary —
to expose sin until its work was complete.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Law Age Speaking in the Present Tense (7:14–25)</h3>

<p>
We know that the Law is spiritual,
but I am fleshly,
sold under sin.
</p>

<p>
I did not practice what I desired,
but did the very thing I hated.
</p>

<p>
If I did what I did not want,
I agreed that the Law was good.
</p>

<p>
But now,
it was no longer I doing it,
but sin dwelling within me.
</p>

<p>
I knew that nothing good dwelt in me —
that is,
in my flesh —
</p>

<p>
for the desire to do good was present,
but the ability to carry it out was not.
</p>

<p>
The good I desired,
I did not do;
the evil I did not desire,
I practiced.
</p>

<p>
If I did what I did not want,
it was no longer I doing it,
but sin dwelling within me.
</p>

<p>
So I found this principle:
when I desired to do good,
evil lay close at hand.
</p>

<p>
I delighted in God’s Law
according to the inner person,
</p>

<p>
but I saw another law at work in my members,
waging war against the law of my mind
and taking me captive
to the law of sin.
</p>

<p>
Wretched man that I was!
Who would rescue me
from this body of death?
</p>

<p>
Thanks be to God
through Jesus Christ our Lord!
</p>

<p>
So then,
with the mind
I served the Law of God,
but with the flesh,
the law of sin.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
Paul uses present tense rhetorically
to voice Israel’s Law-bound experience
as it stood on the brink of covenant release.
This is not the Christian norm.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Romans 7 is covenant autobiography, not Christian psychology</h3>
<p>
Paul speaks representatively for Israel,
not introspectively for believers.
</p>

<h3>2) The “I” is Israel under Law</h3>
<p>
The struggle described belongs to a world
where the Law commanded
but did not empower.
</p>

<h3>3) “Body of death” names the old covenant system</h3>
<p>
This is not physical flesh.
It is a corporate body
held under condemnation.
</p>

<h3>4) Thanksgiving ends the Law’s voice</h3>
<p>
Romans 7 does not end in despair.
It hands the microphone to Romans 8.
</p>

<h2>Prophecy Hub Connections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>End of the old covenant order</strong> —
    <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/2peter3.html">2 Peter 3</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Death swallowed up in victory</strong> —
    <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/resurrection/1cor15.html">1 Corinthians 15</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Believers do not live in Romans 7.
</p>

<p>
Romans 7 explains
why Romans 8 is necessary —
and why it is final.
</p>

<p>
Life in Christ is not life under tension
between desire and failure.
It is life in the Spirit,
free from condemnation
and released from the Law.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where might I still interpret struggle
as normal Christian life,
instead of recognising it
as a sign of a world that has already passed?
