<h1>Romans 10</h1>
<h2>The Near Word · Faith’s Righteousness · The End of Law-Righteousness</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Zeal Without Knowledge (Romans 10:1–4)</h2>

<p><strong>10:1–2</strong> Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is for their salvation. I testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>10:3–4</strong> Not knowing the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. For Christ is the goal and completion of the Law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Righteousness of Faith Is Near (Romans 10:5–13)</h2>

<p><strong>10:5</strong> Moses writes that the person who does the righteousness that is from the Law will live by it.</p>

<p><strong>10:6–8</strong> But the righteousness that is from faith speaks this way: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down), or “Who will descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? “The word is near you — in your mouth and in your heart.”</p>

<p><strong>10:9–10</strong> If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses unto salvation.</p>

<p><strong>10:11–13</strong> Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in Him will not be put to shame.” There is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, rich toward all who call on Him. For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Sent, Heard, and Rejected (Romans 10:14–21)</h2>

<p><strong>10:14–15</strong> How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a herald? And how will they herald unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news.”</p>

<p><strong>10:16–17</strong> But not all obeyed the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.</p>

<p><strong>10:18–21</strong> But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed they did: “Their voice has gone out to all the land.” But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, “I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation.” Isaiah is bold and says, “I was found by those who did not seek Me.” But of Israel He says, “All day long I have held out My hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 10 continues Paul’s explanation of Israel’s stumbling.
The issue is not lack of zeal, effort, or religious devotion.
The issue is refusal to submit to God’s righteousness revealed in Christ.
</p>

<p>
Paul contrasts two systems: Law-righteousness that must be climbed and achieved,
and faith-righteousness that is already present, near, and announced.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) Zeal cannot substitute for submission</h3>
<p>
Israel’s problem was not indifference.
It was devotion to the wrong covenant mechanism.
Zeal for Law became resistance to Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) Christ is the goal, not the cancellation, of the Law</h3>
<p>
Paul’s claim is precise: Christ is the Law’s telos — its aim and completion.
The Law reaches its destination in Him and no longer functions as a pathway to righteousness.
</p>

<h3>3) The “near word” announces covenant accessibility</h3>
<p>
By quoting Deuteronomy, Paul shows that righteousness by faith was always promised.
There is no ascent, descent, or heroic effort required.
The message is present, spoken, and received.
</p>

<h3>4) Confession is allegiance, not formula</h3>
<p>
“Jesus is Lord” is a public loyalty claim.
In the first century, this directly challenged temple authority and imperial claims.
Confession aligns the believer with the risen Messiah.
</p>

<h3>5) Universal access fulfills prophetic intent</h3>
<p>
“No distinction” is covenant language.
The promise expands beyond ethnic Israel without erasing Israel’s story.
This fulfills the prophets’ vision of nations joining the people of God.
</p>

<h3>6) Israel’s resistance was foreseen</h3>
<p>
Paul closes with Moses and Isaiah.
Israel’s refusal is not a surprise — it is part of the prophetic narrative.
God’s hands remain extended even as the covenant order shifts.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Romans 10 removes spiritual distance.
You do not climb to God.
You respond to Him.
Righteousness is not achieved by effort but received through trust.
</p>

<p>
Faith is not denial of obedience —
it is obedience to the truth already revealed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be striving upward instead of responding to what is already near —
and how does this chapter call me back to simple trust?
</p>
