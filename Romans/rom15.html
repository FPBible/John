<h1>Romans 15</h1>
<h2>One Voice · Shared Hope · The Nations Glorifying God</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Bearing With One Another (Romans 15:1–6)</h2>

<p><strong>15:1–2</strong> We who are strong ought to bear with the weaknesses of those without strength, and not to please ourselves. Each of us should please his neighbour for his good, to build him up.</p>

<p><strong>15:3–4</strong> For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.” Whatever was written beforehand was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</p>

<p><strong>15:5–6</strong> May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, so that together with one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — One People, Jew and Gentile (Romans 15:7–13)</h2>

<p><strong>15:7</strong> Therefore welcome one another, just as Christ has welcomed you, to the glory of God.</p>

<p><strong>15:8–9</strong> Christ became a servant to the circumcised to confirm the promises given to the fathers, and so that the nations might glorify God for His mercy.</p>

<p><strong>15:10–12</strong> As it is written: “Rejoice, O nations, with His people.” “Praise the Lord, all you nations.” “The root of Jesse will arise; in Him the nations will hope.”</p>

<p><strong>15:13</strong> May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Paul’s Ministry and Mission (Romans 15:14–21)</h2>

<p><strong>15:14–16</strong> I am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness and knowledge. But I have written boldly to remind you, because of the grace given to me by God, to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations.</p>

<p><strong>15:17–19</strong> I boast only in what Christ has accomplished through me, bringing the nations to obedience by word and deed, by the power of signs and the Spirit — so that from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p><strong>15:20–21</strong> I make it my ambition to proclaim the gospel where Christ was not named, as it is written, “Those who were not told about Him will see.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Travel Plans and Prayer (Romans 15:22–33)</h2>

<p><strong>15:22–24</strong> This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you. But now I hope to see you as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey by you.</p>

<p><strong>15:25–27</strong> At present I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints. For the nations have shared in their spiritual blessings, and they owe it to them to share material blessings.</p>

<p><strong>15:30–33</strong> I appeal to you to strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf, so that I may be delivered from unbelievers and that my service may be acceptable. May the God of peace be with you all.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 15 draws the ethical and covenant threads together.
The goal of the Gospel is not uniformity,
but unified worship — many voices glorifying God as one.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Covenant Unity)</h2>

<h3>1) Strength exists to serve</h3>
<p>
Maturity is measured by willingness to carry others.
This reflects Christ’s pattern and defines New Creation leadership.
</p>

<h3>2) Scripture points toward shared hope</h3>
<p>
Paul reads Israel’s Scriptures as forward-looking,
aimed at the inclusion of the nations.
Fulfillment does not erase Israel;
it completes her vocation.
</p>

<h3>3) One voice does not mean one culture</h3>
<p>
Unity is expressed in worship, not sameness.
Diversity remains, but hostility is removed.
</p>

<h3>4) Gentile inclusion is prophetic fulfillment</h3>
<p>
Paul strings together multiple OT texts
to show that Gentile praise was always intended.
This is not a plan B.
</p>

<h3>5) Mission flows from fulfillment, not delay</h3>
<p>
Paul’s urgency rests on the conviction
that God’s promises are active and advancing,
not postponed.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>

The Gospel produces harmony without erasing difference.
</p>

<p>
The New Creation community exists to display mercy —
together, with one voice.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be prioritising comfort over building others up —
and how does Christ’s example reframe my understanding of strength?
