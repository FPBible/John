<h1>Romans 5</h1>
<h2>From Adam to Christ — Death Replaced by Life</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Peace, Hope, and Reconciliation (Romans 5:1–11)</h2>

<p><strong>5:1–2</strong> Therefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through Him we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of sharing in God’s glory.</p>

<p><strong>5:3–5</strong> Not only this, but we also boast in sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, endurance produces tested character, and tested character produces hope. This hope does not disappoint, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</p>

<p><strong>5:6–8</strong> While we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Rarely will someone die for a righteous person — though for a good person someone might dare to die. But God demonstrates His love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p><strong>5:9–11</strong> Much more then, having now been declared righteous by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. And not only that — we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Adam and Christ (Romans 5:12–21)</h2>

<p><strong>5:12</strong> Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all people, because all sinned.</p>

<p><strong>5:13–14</strong> Sin was in the world before the Law, but sin is not charged when there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression — who is a pattern of the One to come.</p>

<p><strong>5:15–17</strong> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through the trespass of one man, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflow to the many. Death reigned through that one — but much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>5:18–19</strong> So then, as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so one act of righteousness resulted in justification and life for all people. For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were constituted sinners, so through the obedience of the One many will be constituted righteous.</p>

<p><strong>5:20–21</strong> The Law came in alongside so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more — so that just as sin reigned in death, grace might reign through righteousness leading to life in Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Romans 5 marks a decisive shift.
Paul moves from explaining justification to explaining its effects.
Peace replaces hostility, access replaces distance, and reconciliation replaces enmity.
Then Paul zooms out to a covenant-wide comparison: Adam and Christ.
</p>

<p>
This is not abstract theology.
It is Paul’s explanation of how one world governed by death
has been overtaken by a new world governed by life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Covenant Transition)</h2>

<h3>1) Peace with God is present, not pending</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say believers <em>will have</em> peace.
He says they <em>have</em> peace.
Hostility has ended because the covenant barrier has been removed.
This is settled status, not emotional mood.
</p>

<h3>2) “Wrath” is covenant consequence, not eternal threat</h3>
<p>
The “wrath” from which believers are saved is the judgment belonging to the old covenant world.
Reconciliation in Christ removes participation in that condemned system.
This is historical and covenantal — not a warning of post-mortem terror.
</p>

<h3>3) Adam represents the old humanity</h3>
<p>
Adam functions as the head of a world characterised by sin and death.
This is not merely biological inheritance.
It is covenantal participation in a system marked by exile, condemnation, and mortality.
</p>

<h3>4) Christ inaugurates a new humanity</h3>
<p>
Jesus is not a patch on Adam.
He is a replacement.
A new head establishes a new order.
Life now reigns where death once ruled.
This is New Creation language.
</p>

<h3>5) “All” language must be read covenantally</h3>
<p>
Paul’s “all” mirrors Adam/Christ categories, not mathematical universality.
Those in Adam share death.
Those in Christ share life.
The point is headship and participation, not abstract totals.
</p>

<h3>6) The Law magnified the problem it could not solve</h3>
<p>
The Law intensified transgression by naming it.
This was not a failure of the Law,
but part of its role in exposing the need for grace.
The solution was never more Law — it was Christ.
</p>

<h3>7) Grace now reigns</h3>
<p>
Paul ends with a throne shift.
Sin once reigned in death.
Now grace reigns through righteousness leading to life.
That reign is not postponed.
It is the present reality of the New Creation world.
</p>
