        A foundational statement for FPBible: how we read, what we mean, and how we live in the New Covenant reality.

      <div class="position">
        <strong>Position statement</strong>
        <p>FPBible is written from the conviction that Christ is present, prophecy is fulfilled, and the New Creation is now.</p>
      </div>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Fulfillment, Not Expectation</h2>
        <p>
          We affirm that the “end of the age” spoken of by Jesus and the prophets was not the end of the physical universe,
          but the completion of Israel’s covenant age. That age reached its appointed conclusion in the first century,
          climaxing in the judgment of Jerusalem and the passing of the temple system.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was not a failed expectation or a postponed promise. It was fulfillment.
          Christian faith does not stand on anticipation of unfinished prophecy, but on the reality that what was promised
          has been accomplished. The old covenant world has ended. A new covenant world has begun.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. The Presence of Christ</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament speaks of Christ’s <em>parousia</em> as more than a momentary arrival. It speaks of
          <strong>presence</strong> — an abiding, royal nearness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is not absent from His kingdom. He has taken His throne. His reign did not begin in the future, nor is it
          delayed until another age. He reigns now, not as a distant ruler, but as a present Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian life is therefore not lived in anxiety or countdown, but in awareness of His nearness.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Life in the New Heavens and New Earth</h2>
        <p>
          Scripture describes the passing of the “former heaven and earth” as the removal of the old covenant order —
          a world structured around temple, priesthood, and boundary.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now live in the New Heavens and New Earth: a renewed covenant reality where access to God is no longer mediated
          by place, ritual, or lineage. The barriers have been removed. The veil is gone. God dwells with His people.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not symbolic optimism. It is the present condition of Christian life.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. The New Jerusalem</h2>
        <p>
          The New Jerusalem is not a future city descending from the sky. It is the living community of God’s people —
          a spiritual city, founded in heaven, expressed on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its gates are always open. Its life flows outward. Its purpose is healing, reconciliation, and life for the nations.
          To belong to Christ is to belong to this city now.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Resurrection and Life</h2>
        <p>
          The gospel proclaims victory over death — not merely biological death, but separation from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Christ, death has lost its dominion. Resurrection life is not postponed until the end of history; it is the
          present inheritance of those who live in Him. Those who die in Christ do not wait in uncertainty. They rest in
          completed redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eternal life is not only future survival. It is present participation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. God All in All</h2>
        <p>
          With the fulfillment of Israel’s covenant mission, God’s relationship with humanity is no longer confined to a single
          nation or sacred geography.
        </p>
        <p>
          We live in the age of God’s unveiled nearness — where worship is not bound to temples, where holiness is not confined
          to rituals, and where God’s presence fills ordinary life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith is no longer about access. It is about awareness. No sacred ground is restricted. No moment is excluded.
          God is all in all.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="analogy">
        <h2>A Living Analogy</h2>
        <p>
          For generations, the world lived under a provisional light — like a lantern used through the night.
          The prophets spoke of a sunrise that would make the lantern unnecessary.
        </p>
        <p><strong>That sunrise has come.</strong></p>
        <p>
          We are not waiting for the day to arrive. We are learning how to live in it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="closing">
        <h2>Closing Statement</h2>
        <p><strong>The New Creation is not an idea to defend. It is a reality to inhabit.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Christian faith, after fulfillment, is not anxious, delayed, or suspended between ages.
          It is grounded, present, and alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not wait for Christ.<br />
          We walk with Him.
