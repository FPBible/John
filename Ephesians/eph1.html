<h1>Ephesians 1</h1>
<h2>Chosen, Raised, and Seated in Christ — A Fulfilled Reality</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH01.htm" target="_blank">
Ephesians 1 — WEB
</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Paul writes to believers living after the decisive work of Christ —
His death, resurrection, exaltation, and the outpouring of the Spirit.
This letter is not announcing what God <em>will</em> do.
It proclaims what God <em>has already done</em> in Christ.
</p>

<p>
Ephesians is not corrective correspondence.
It is declarative.
Paul describes the settled identity of those who now live
in the New Covenant world.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Spiritual Blessing Already Given (1:1–6)</h3>

<p>
Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has already blessed us
with every spiritual blessing
in the heavenly realm in Christ.
</p>

<p>
He chose us in Him before the foundation of the covenant world,
so that we would stand holy and blameless before Him in love.
</p>

<p>
He predestined us for adoption —
placing us as sons through Jesus Christ —
according to the good pleasure of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace
that He freely poured out on us in the Beloved.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Redemption and Revelation Accomplished (1:7–10)</h3>

<p>
In Him we have redemption through His blood —
the release from sins —
according to the richness of His grace.
</p>

<p>
That grace overflowed toward us
with wisdom and insight,
making known to us the mystery of His will,
which had been hidden in previous ages.
</p>

<p>
This mystery has now been revealed:
to unite all things in Christ —
things in heaven and things on earth —
at the completion of the appointed times.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Inheritance Received, Not Awaited (1:11–14)</h3>

<p>
In Him we were assigned an inheritance,
having been predestined according to the purpose of Him
who works all things according to His will.
</p>

<p>
We were the first to hope in the Messiah,
so that we would be for the praise of His glory.
</p>

<p>
In Him, you also —
having heard the word of truth,
the gospel of your salvation —
believed and were sealed
with the promised Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit is the guarantee that the inheritance is ours,
until the full possession was secured —
to the praise of His glory.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfilled clarification:</strong>
The “until” language does not delay inheritance.
It marks the transition period
that culminated in the public closure of the old covenant order.
The inheritance is now fully possessed in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Eyes Opened to Present Authority (1:15–19)</h3>

<p>
For this reason,
I do not stop giving thanks for you,
remembering you in my prayers,
</p>

<p>
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ
would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation,
so that you would know Him more fully.
</p>

<p>
I pray that the eyes of your heart would be enlightened,
so that you would know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the hope to which you have been called</li>
  <li>the richness of His glorious inheritance among the saints</li>
  <li>the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe</li>
</ul>

<p>
This power is already at work —
the same power that raised Christ from the dead.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Christ Exalted, Authority Settled (1:20–23)</h3>

<p>
God raised Christ from the dead
and seated Him at His right hand
in the heavenly realm —
</p>

<p>
far above every ruler,
authority,
power,
and dominion,
and every name that is named —
not only in that age,
but also in the one that has now come.
</p>

<p>
He placed all things under His feet
and gave Him as head over all things for the assembly,
</p>

<p>
which is His body,
the fullness of Him
who fills all things in every way.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Prophetic fulfilment:</strong>
This language echoes Daniel 7:13–14.
The authority of the Son of Man is not pending.
It has been received.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Heavenly places” is present covenant reality</h3>
<p>
“Heavenly places” does not describe a future location.
It describes a realm of authority and access.
Believers share Christ’s exalted status now,
not later.
</p>

<h3>2) Election is corporate and Christ-centred</h3>
<p>
God chose a people <em>in Christ</em>,
not isolated individuals in abstraction.
Election is about covenant identity,
not fatalism.
</p>

<h3>3) The mystery is no longer hidden</h3>
<p>
The mystery is not future insight.
It is the revealed inclusion of Jew and Gentile
into one renewed humanity.
</p>

<h3>4) Authority language is covenantal, not cosmic sci-fi</h3>
<p>
Rulers and powers refer to governing structures
that held authority under the old order.
Christ’s exaltation signals their displacement.
</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Believers are not waiting to be raised,
adopted,
or enthroned.
</p>

<p>
They live from:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed redemption</li>
  <li>revealed inheritance</li>
  <li>shared authority in Christ</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ephesians 1 does not point forward.
It declares where life now exists.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
If Christ is already seated
and I am already in Him,
where am I still thinking like life is on hold?
