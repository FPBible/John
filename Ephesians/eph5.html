<h1>Ephesians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 5 — Walking as Light in a New Creation World</h2>

<h3>Imitators of God in Love</h3>

<p>
Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children,
and walk in love, just as Christ loved us
and gave Himself up for us —
a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
Sexual immorality, impurity of any kind, or greed
must not even be named among you,
as is fitting for holy people.
Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking,
which are out of place,
but rather thanksgiving.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:3–4)</a>
</p>

<p>
For you know this:
no sexually immoral, impure, or greedy person —
who is an idolater —
has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Let no one deceive you with empty words,
for because of such things
the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
Therefore do not become partners with them.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:5–7)</a>
</p>

<h3>From Darkness to Light</h3>

<p>
For you were once darkness,
but now you are light in the Lord.
Walk as children of light —
for the fruit of the light consists of all goodness,
righteousness, and truth —
testing what pleases the Lord.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:8–10)</a>
</p>

<p>
Have no partnership with the unfruitful works of darkness,
but instead expose them.
For it is shameful even to speak of the things done by them in secret.
But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
for everything that becomes visible is light.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:11–13)</a>
</p>

<p>
For this reason it says,
“Awake, sleeper,
rise from the dead,
and Christ will shine on you.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:14)</a>
</p>

<h3>Living Wisely in the Present Age</h3>

<p>
So pay careful attention to how you walk —
not as unwise, but as wise,
making the most of the opportunity,
because the days are evil.
Therefore do not be foolish,
but understand what the will of the Lord is.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:15–17)</a>
</p>

<p>
Do not get drunk with wine, which leads to reckless living,
but be filled with the Spirit,
speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord,
always giving thanks to God the Father for everything,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:18–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>Mutual Submission and Covenant Love</h3>

<p>
Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:21)</a>
</p>

<p>
Wives, align with your husbands as to the Lord,
because the husband is the head of the wife,
as Christ is the head of the church —
He Himself being the saviour of the body.
But as the church aligns with Christ,
so also wives are to align with their husbands in everything.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:22–24)</a>
</p>

<p>
Husbands, love your wives,
just as Christ loved the church
and gave Himself up for her,
so that He might make her holy,
cleansing her by the washing of water with the word,
so that He might present the church to Himself in splendour,
without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
but holy and blameless.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:25–27)</a>
</p>

<p>
In the same way,
husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.
He who loves his wife loves himself.
For no one ever hated his own flesh,
but nourishes and cherishes it,
just as Christ does the church,
because we are members of His body.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:28–30)</a>
</p>

<p>
“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother
and be joined to his wife,
and the two will become one flesh.”
This mystery is great,
but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
Nevertheless, each one of you is to love his wife as himself,
and the wife is to respect her husband.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:31–33)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 5</h2>

<h3>1) Imitating God means living from revealed love</h3>
<p>
Paul does not tell believers to imitate God by power or control,
but by love.
Christ’s self-giving defines what God-likeness looks like in the New Creation.
Imitation flows from identity as beloved children, not from pressure to perform.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:1–2)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Holiness protects communion, not reputation</h3>
<p>
Paul’s warnings about sexual immorality, greed, and corrupt speech
are not moral panic.
They are relational protection.
These practices fracture trust and consume people.
Holiness in the New Creation is about guarding shared life, not polishing appearances.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:3–5)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) “Wrath” names the consequence of living outside the New Creation</h3>
<p>
Paul’s language reflects covenant consequence, not divine volatility.
To live in darkness is to remain under destructive patterns.
The warning is real, but it is not a threat against those in Christ.
It is a call not to re-partner with what destroys life.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:6–7)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Light is identity before it is behaviour</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say, “behave better so you can become light.”
He says, “you are light in the Lord.”
Walking as light means letting identity govern action.
Exposure of darkness happens naturally when light is lived, not forced.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:8–13)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Awakening language calls believers to live from resurrection reality</h3>
<p>
“Awake, sleeper” is resurrection language.
It calls believers to consciousness of what is already true.
Christ’s shining is not future arrival,
but present illumination for those living from the New Creation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:14)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) Wisdom is alignment with God’s will, not escape from the world</h3>
<p>
Making the most of the time does not mean panic.
It means living intentionally in a fractured age.
Spirit-filled life is contrasted with numbing intoxication:
one dulls awareness, the other heightens it.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:15–18)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) Mutual submission reframes all authority</h3>
<p>
Paul begins the household section with mutual submission.
This governs everything that follows.
Authority in the New Creation is cruciform:
expressed through service, self-giving, and care.
Any reading that restores domination ignores Paul’s opening frame.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:21)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) Marriage imagery points beyond itself to Christ and the church</h3>
<p>
Paul uses marriage to describe covenant union.
The controlling image is Christ’s self-giving love,
not power imbalance.
This passage is not about enforcing roles,
but about revealing how love sanctifies and nurtures.
The “mystery” is union, not hierarchy.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:25–32)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 5 shows what New Creation life looks like when it matures:
love embodied, light lived out, wisdom practised,
and relationships shaped by Christ’s self-giving presence.
