<h1>Ephesians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 5 — Walking as Light</h2>

<p><em>
Ephesians 5 is not describing how to earn an inheritance.
It describes how New Creation people live because they already belong to Christ’s kingdom life.
</em></p>

<h3>Imitate God in Love</h3>

<p>
Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children,
and walk in love,
as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us —
an offering and sacrifice to God, a pleasing fragrance.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:1–2)</a>
</p>

<h3>Clean Living Fits Your Identity</h3>

<p>
But sexual immorality and every kind of impurity or greed
must not even be named among you,
as is fitting for saints.
Let there be no filthiness or foolish talk or crude joking,
which are out of place,
but instead let there be thanksgiving.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:3–4)</a>
</p>

<p>
For you know this with certainty:
no sexually immoral or impure person,
or greedy person (who is an idolater),
has an inheritance within the kingdom-life of Christ and God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:5)</a>

<strong>Clarification — “Inheritance in the Kingdom”</strong><br />
Paul is not describing a distant payout.
“Inheritance” is covenant belonging — sharing in the life of God’s kingdom now.
Persistent darkness is incompatible with that life.
This is identity logic: live consistent with what you are in Christ.
</div>

<h3>Reject Empty Deception</h3>

<p>
Let no one deceive you with empty words,
for because of these things the wrath of God comes
upon the sons of disobedience.
Therefore do not become partners with them.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:6–7)</a>
</p>

<h3>From Darkness to Light</h3>

<p>
For at one time you were darkness,
but now you are light in the Lord.
Walk as children of light,
for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,
testing what is pleasing to the Lord.
Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness,
but rather expose them.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:8–11)</a>
</p>

<p>
For it is shameful even to speak of the things they do in secret.
But when anything is exposed by the light,
it becomes visible;
for anything that becomes visible is light.
Therefore it says,
“Awake, O sleeper,
and rise from the dead,
and Christ will shine on you.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:12–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>Wisdom, Not Drift</h3>

<p>
Look carefully then how you walk,
not as unwise but as wise,
making the most of the time,
because the days are evil.
Therefore do not be foolish,
but understand what the will of the Lord is.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:15–17)</a>
</p>

<p>
And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery,
but be filled with the Spirit,
speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart,
giving thanks always and for everything
to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:18–21)</a>
</p>

<h3>Household Order in the Lord</h3>

<p>
Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
For the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church,
His body, and is Himself its saviour.
Now as the church submits to Christ,
so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:22–24)</a>
</p>

<p>
Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
and gave Himself up for her,
that He might sanctify her,
having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
so that He might present the church to Himself in splendour,
without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
that she might be holy and without blemish.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:25–27)</a>
</p>

<p>
In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.
He who loves his wife loves himself.
For no one ever hated his own flesh,
but nourishes and cherishes it,
just as Christ does the church,
because we are members of His body.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:28–30)</a>
</p>

<p>
“Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife,
and the two shall become one flesh.”
This mystery is great —
and I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
Nevertheless, let each one of you love his wife as himself,
and let the wife respect her husband.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:31–33)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 5</h2>

<h3>1) Holiness is “fitting,” not fearful</h3>
<p>
Paul does not motivate by looming future threat.
He motivates by congruence:
this is what matches who you are.
New Creation ethics are identity-aligned living.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:3–4,8)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Inheritance language is covenant belonging</h3>
<p>
Inheritance is not delayed payment.
It is participation in the kingdom-life of Christ now.
Persistent darkness is not a “small mistake” —
it is a refusal of the life you were called into.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:5)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) “Awake, sleeper” is a call to present illumination</h3>
<p>
The call is not “wait for Christ to shine later.”
It is an invitation to step into light now —
to live awake, clear, and open.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:14)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Marriage is a living parable of covenant love</h3>
<p>
Paul is not giving abstract domestic advice.
He is describing how covenant love behaves:
self-giving, nourishing, faithful, honouring.
The “mystery” points to Christ and the church as a unified body.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH05.htm">(Eph 5:25–32)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 5 is New Creation behaviour:
love as the operating system,
light as the atmosphere,
and relationships shaped by Christ’s self-giving rule.
