<h1>Ephesians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 6 — Standing in a Finished Victory</h2>

<h3>New Covenant Households Continued</h3>

<p>
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
“Honour your father and mother” —
which is the first commandment with a promise —
so that it may go well with you
and that you may live long on the land.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:1–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger,
but raise them with instruction and guidance in the Lord.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:4)</a>
</p>

<p>
Servants, obey your earthly masters with respect and sincerity,
as you would Christ —
not only while being watched,
as people-pleasers,
but as servants of Christ,
doing God’s will from the heart.
Serve willingly,
as serving the Lord and not people,
knowing that whatever good anyone does,
this they will receive back from the Lord,
whether servant or free.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:5–8)</a>
</p>

<p>
And masters, do the same toward them.
Stop threatening,
knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven,
and there is no partiality with Him.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:9)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Armour of God</h3>

<p>
Finally, be strong in the Lord
and in the strength of His might.
Put on the full armour of God,
so that you may stand against the schemes of the adversary.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:10–11)</a>
</p>

<p>
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
but against rulers, authorities,
the powers of this darkness,
and the spiritual forces of evil
in the heavenly realm.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:12)</a>
</p>

<p>
For this reason, take up the full armour of God,
so that you may be able to stand in the evil day,
and having done everything, to stand.
Stand firm, therefore,
having fastened the belt of truth around your waist,
and having put on the breastplate of righteousness.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:13–14)</a>
</p>

<p>
And having fitted your feet
with the readiness of the gospel of peace,
in every situation taking up the shield of faith,
with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
Take the helmet of salvation
and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:15–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>Prayer as Ongoing Participation</h3>

<p>
Pray at all times in the Spirit,
with every prayer and request.
Stay alert with all perseverance
and intercession for all the saints.
Pray also for me,
that a message may be given to me
when I open my mouth,
to make known with boldness
the mystery of the gospel —
for which I am an ambassador in chains —
so that I may speak boldly,
as I ought to speak.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:18–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>Final Greetings</h3>

<p>
So that you also may know how I am
and what I am doing,
Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord,
will tell you everything.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose,
that you may know how we are
and that he may encourage your hearts.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:21–22)</a>
</p>

<p>
Peace to the brothers and sisters,
and love with faith,
from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ
with an undying love.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:23–24)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 6</h2>

<h3>1) Authority in the New Creation is restrained, not absolute</h3>
<p>
Paul completes the household instructions by flattening power.
Masters are explicitly warned: they answer to a higher Master.
This prevents any theology that sanctifies domination.
The New Creation does not erase social realities overnight,
but it decisively redefines how authority is exercised.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:9)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Strength is derived, not self-generated</h3>
<p>
“Be strong in the Lord” signals dependence.
This is not inner grit or spiritual bravado.
Strength flows from participation in Christ’s already-established reign.
The believer stands because Christ already reigns.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) The conflict is systemic and spiritual, not personal</h3>
<p>
Paul explicitly removes flesh-and-blood from the target list.
The struggle is against powers and authorities —
structures, systems, and spiritual influences that resist reconciliation.
This guards the New Creation from becoming tribal or violent.
People are not the enemy; the old order is.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:12)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Armour language is about standing, not advancing conquest</h3>
<p>
Paul’s repeated verb is “stand.”
This is defensive imagery, not imperial expansion.
The victory is already won;
the call is to remain grounded in it.
Every piece of armour corresponds to New Covenant reality:
truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and the Spirit’s word.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:13–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) The “evil day” is pressure, not postponement</h3>
<p>
Paul does not define an end-times calendar.
The “evil day” is any moment of intensified opposition.
Standing does not mean escape;
it means remaining aligned with truth under pressure.
Fulfillment does not remove conflict —
it removes uncertainty about the outcome.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:13)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) Prayer is participation in Christ’s mission</h3>
<p>
Prayer here is not defensive retreat.
It is alert, persistent engagement.
Paul asks not for release from chains,
but for clarity and boldness in proclamation.
That reveals how the New Creation advances —
through truth spoken under pressure.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:18–20)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) Chains do not contradict authority</h3>
<p>
Paul calls himself an ambassador in chains.
That is the New Creation paradox:
authority expressed through apparent weakness.
The message is not validated by comfort,
but by faithfulness.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:20)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) Ephesians ends with love that does not decay</h3>
<p>
Paul’s final blessing centres on love with incorruptibility.
This is covenant language —
a love that belongs to the New Creation and cannot be undone.
The letter ends where it began:
grace, peace, and union in Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH06.htm">(Eph 6:23–24)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 6 closes the letter by grounding believers in reality:
the victory is finished, the powers are exposed,
and the call is not to fight harder,
but to stand firm in what Christ has already secured.
