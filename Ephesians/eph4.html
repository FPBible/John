<h1>Ephesians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 4 — Living the New Humanity</h2>

<p><em>
Ephesians 4 moves from identity to embodiment.
Paul is not describing how believers become the New Creation,
but how they live from what has already been established in Christ.
</em></p>

<h3>A Life Worthy of the Calling</h3>

<p>
Therefore I urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
with which you have been called —
with all humility and gentleness,
with patience,
bearing with one another in love,
eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit
in the bond of peace.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:1–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
There is one body and one Spirit —
just as you were called to one hope belonging to your calling —
one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
one God and Father of all,
who is over all and through all and in all.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:4–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>Grace Given for Growth</h3>

<p>
But grace was given to each one of us
according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
Therefore it says,
“When He ascended on high He led captivity captive,
and He gave gifts to people.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:7–8)</a>
</p>

<p>
He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens,
so that He might fill all things.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>Gifts for Maturity</h3>

<p>
He gave some as apostles,
some as prophets,
some as evangelists,
and some as shepherds and teachers,
to equip the saints for the work of service,
for building up the body of Christ,
as the body grows into the shared faith
and the full knowledge of the Son of God,
into mature humanity,
into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:11–13)</a>
</p>

<p>
So that we are no longer children,
tossed back and forth by waves
and carried about by every wind of teaching,
by human trickery,
by craftiness in deceitful schemes.
Rather, speaking the truth in love,
we grow up in every way into Him who is the head — Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:14–15)</a>
</p>

<p>
From Him the whole body,
joined and held together by every supporting ligament,
grows and builds itself up in love,
as each part does its work.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:16)</a>
</p>

<h3>Putting Off the Old Way</h3>

<p>
So I say this and insist in the Lord:
you must no longer walk as the nations walk,
in the futility of their minds.
They are darkened in understanding,
alienated from the life of God
because of the ignorance that is in them,
due to hardness of heart.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:17–18)</a>
</p>

<p>
But that is not how you learned Christ —
assuming you heard Him
and were taught in Him,
as the truth is in Jesus.
You were taught to put off your former way of life,
the old humanity corrupted by deceitful desires,
and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
and to put on the new humanity,
created according to God in righteousness
and holiness of the truth.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:20–24)</a>
</p>

<h3>Living Out the New Humanity</h3>

<p>
Therefore, having put away falsehood,
let each one speak truth with his neighbour,
for we are members of one another.
Be angry and do not sin;
do not let the sun go down on your anger,
and give no opportunity to the accuser.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:25–27)</a>
</p>

<p>
Let the thief no longer steal,
but rather let him labour,
doing honest work with his own hands,
so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.
Let no corrupt talk come out of your mouths,
but only what is good for building up,
as fits the occasion,
that it may give grace to those who hear.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:28–29)</a>
</p>

<p>
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
and shouting and slander be put away from you,
along with all malice.
Be kind to one another,
tenderhearted,
forgiving one another,
just as God in Christ forgave you.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:30–32)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 4</h2>

<h3>1) Unity is a given, not a goal</h3>
<p>
Paul never tells believers to create unity.
He tells them to preserve it.
Unity exists because Christ has already made one body.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:3–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) “Maturity” is communal, not individual perfection</h3>
<p>
Paul’s mature humanity is a corporate reality —
the body growing into coherence under its Head.
This is not about reaching sinless status,
but about functioning together as one.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:13)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Growth flows from fullness, not lack</h3>
<p>
Christ already fills all things.
Growth is the outworking of that fullness,
not an attempt to obtain it.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:10–16)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Ethics express identity</h3>
<p>
Paul’s moral instructions are not threats.
They are invitations to live consistently
with who believers already are in Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH04.htm">(Eph 4:25–32)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 4 shows what New Creation life looks like on the ground:
unity kept,
truth spoken,
anger restrained,
and love embodied.
