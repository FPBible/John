<h1>Ephesians 4</h1>
<h2>Walking Worthy · One Body · Growing Into Christ</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Call to Walk in Unity (Eph 4:1–6)</h2>

<p><strong>4:1–3</strong> Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, urge you to walk worthy of the calling you have received — with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>

<p><strong>4:4–6</strong> There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Gifts Given for Growth (Eph 4:7–16)</h2>

<p><strong>4:7–10</strong> But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it says: “When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to people.” Now what does “He ascended” mean except that He also descended into the lower regions of the earth? He who descended is the same One who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.</p>

<p><strong>4:11–13</strong> And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some shepherds and teachers — to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all reach the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature humanity, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>

<p><strong>4:14–16</strong> Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by human trickery, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we grow in every way into Him who is the head — Christ. From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Put Off the Old Pattern, Put On the New (Eph 4:17–24)</h2>

<p><strong>4:17–19</strong> So I say this and affirm in the Lord: you must no longer walk as the nations walk, in the futility of their thinking. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their hearts. Having become callous, they gave themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greed.</p>

<p><strong>4:20–21</strong> But that is not how you learned Christ — if indeed you heard Him and were taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>4:22–24</strong> You were taught to put off the old human, which is being corrupted according to deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new human, created according to God in true righteousness and holiness.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — New Humanity in Daily Speech and Action (Eph 4:25–32)</h2>

<p><strong>4:25</strong> Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbour, because we are members of one another.</p>

<p><strong>4:26–27</strong> Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the adversary an opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>4:28</strong> The one who steals must no longer steal, but rather must labour, doing good work with his hands, so that he may have something to share with those in need.</p>

<p><strong>4:29–30</strong> Let no corrupt word come out of your mouth, but only what is good for building up as the need requires, so that it may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</p>

<p><strong>4:31–32</strong> Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, shouting, and slander be removed from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 4 marks the shift from declaration to demonstration.
Paul is not adding conditions.
He is showing what life looks like when unity is real.
</p>

<p>
The command to “walk worthy” is not pressure —
it is alignment with what has already been established.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) Unity is preserved, not manufactured</h3>
<p>
Paul does not tell believers to create unity.
He tells them to preserve it.
Unity already exists because peace has been established in Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) “One” language dismantles hierarchy</h3>
<p>
One body, one Spirit, one Lord.
This is not poetry.
It is the end of layered spiritual status.
</p>

<h3>3) Ministry gifts serve maturity, not control</h3>
<p>
Gifts are given to equip, not dominate.
When gifts become platforms, the body stops growing.
</p>

<h3>4) Ascension language is victory language</h3>
<p>
Paul quotes enthronement imagery to show Christ’s reign is complete.
The giving of gifts flows from victory, not from lack.
</p>

<h3>5) The “old human” belongs to a passing world</h3>
<p>
The old pattern is not your true self.
It is a learned way of living formed under alienation.
It no longer defines you.
</p>

<h3>6) Renewal happens at the level of thinking</h3>
<p>
Transformation is not rule enforcement.
It is the renewal of perception —
learning to see yourself and others through Christ.
</p>

<h3>7) Ethics flow from belonging</h3>
<p>
Truthful speech, honest work, forgiveness, restraint —
these are not hoops.
They are expressions of shared life.
</p>

<h3>8) “Grieving the Spirit” is relational, not mystical</h3>
<p>
Paul links grieving the Spirit to community damage.
The Spirit seals unity.
Relational fracture contradicts His work.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Prophecy Fulfilment</h2>

<p>
Ephesians 4 does not introduce new prophecy.
It shows the lived effect of fulfillment:
a people no longer divided by covenant boundaries,
growing together under one Head.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>

<p>
You don’t walk worthy to earn unity.
You walk worthy because unity already exists.
</p>

<p>
Growth is not about becoming someone else.
It is about growing into who you already are in Christ —
together.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I still living from old patterns of separation,
defensiveness, or self-protection,
instead of trusting the unity already given in Christ?
</p>
