<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read Ephesians</h2>

<hr />

<h2>This Letter Is Declarative, Not Predictive</h2>

<p>
Ephesians does not speculate about what God will one day do.
It proclaims what God has already accomplished in Christ.
</p>

<p>
Paul writes after the decisive events of the gospel:
the death of Jesus,
His resurrection,
His exaltation,
and the outpouring of the Spirit.
The letter assumes these realities as settled.
</p>

<p>
Nothing in Ephesians is framed as a distant hope.
Everything is announced as present truth.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Covenant World Has Changed</h2>

<p>
Ephesians assumes a fundamental transition:
the old covenant world — defined by Law,
ethnic boundary,
temple mediation,
and condemnation —
has been brought to its end.
</p>

<p>
In its place,
God has established a New Covenant world:
one humanity in Christ,
direct access to the Father,
shared life in the Spirit,
and authority under a risen and enthroned Lord.
</p>

<p>
This letter does not call believers
to prepare for that change.
It announces that the change has occurred.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Time Matters in This Letter</h2>

<p>
Paul repeatedly uses language of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>“now revealed”</li>
  <li>“formerly” and “but now”</li>
  <li>“ages” and their completion</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are not rhetorical flourishes.
They mark a real historical transition
that took place within the first century
and was publicly confirmed
by the collapse of the old covenant order.
</p>

<p>
Ephesians is written from the far side of that transition,
addressing people who now live
in the New Creation world it describes.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Heavenly Places, Not Future Geography</h2>

<p>
When Paul speaks of “heavenly places,”
he is not describing a future location.
He is describing present access,
shared authority,
and covenant position in Christ.
</p>

<p>
This language is covenantal,
not spatial.
It belongs to the same world of meaning
as priesthood,
inheritance,
and kingship —
all of which Ephesians treats as present realities.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How Ethical Instructions Function</h2>

<p>
The commands in Ephesians are not conditions for acceptance.
They are alignment with identity.
</p>

<p>
Paul does not say,
“Live this way so you can belong.”
He says,
“Live this way because this is who you already are.”
</p>

<p>
Every exhortation in chapters 4–6
flows from the finished reconciliation
announced in chapters 1–3.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What This Reading Rejects</h2>

<p>
This reading explicitly rejects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the “already / not yet” framework</li>
  <li>postponed inheritance or authority</li>
  <li>future temple, priesthood, or covenant identity</li>
  <li>fear-based interpretations of judgment language</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ephesians only functions coherently
when read as fulfilled.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>An Invitation</h2>

<p>
Ephesians is not asking you to strive toward life.
It is inviting you to recognise
where life already exists.
</p>

<p>
Read slowly.
Pay attention to tense.
Notice how often Paul says
“has,”
“is,”
and
“now.”
</p>

<p>
This letter announces a world made new.
It teaches you how to live
as someone who belongs to it.
