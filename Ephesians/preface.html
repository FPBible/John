<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read Ephesians</h2>

<p>
Ephesians is a letter of identity and formation.
Paul is not trying to scare believers into compliance.
He is showing them what is already true in Christ —
and then teaching them how to live from it together.
</p>

<p>
This letter reads like a declaration:
<strong>you are in Christ, you are reconciled, you are part of one new humanity,
and you are seated in a new realm of authority and access.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What Ephesians Is Doing</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Identity:</strong> blessing, adoption, inheritance, sealing, and access in Christ</li>
  <li><strong>Unity:</strong> Jew and Gentile formed into one body without covenant walls</li>
  <li><strong>Formation:</strong> how the new humanity speaks, forgives, works, and loves</li>
  <li><strong>Vocation:</strong> the church as God’s public display of wisdom in the world</li>
  <li><strong>Stability:</strong> standing firm without fear-based spirituality</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>How This Fits the Fulfilled / New Creation Lens</h2>

<p>
Ephesians assumes the decisive reconciliation has been completed in Christ.
It speaks from the reality of a new covenant people being formed
as the old boundary system loses its authority.
</p>

<p>
You will see covenant transition themes throughout the letter:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>language of “inheritance” and “sealed” identity</li>
  <li>the breaking down of the dividing wall</li>
  <li>new creation ethics replacing rule-based spirituality</li>
  <li>the collapse of fear-driven “powers” thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ephesians does not invite believers to wait for a future status.
It calls them to live from a present status:
<strong>you are already brought near, already reconciled, already included.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Phrases to Watch</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>“In Christ”</strong> — union as the basis of everything</li>
  <li><strong>“Heavenly places”</strong> — realm of authority and access, not geography</li>
  <li><strong>“One new humanity”</strong> — a new people formed beyond covenant boundaries</li>
  <li><strong>“Walk”</strong> — lived identity (speech, relationships, work, love)</li>
  <li><strong>“Powers and authorities”</strong> — intimidation structures under Christ’s rule</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>How to Use the Commentary</h2>

<p>
The paraphrase sections aim to stay close to the flow of the text in clear modern language.
The commentary sections then make the implications explicit:
what Paul meant then, what had changed in Christ,
and what New Creation life looks like now.
</p>

<p>
If you are new to this framework:
read the chapter first without the commentary.
Then return to the commentary and cross-references.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>An Invitation</h2>

<p>
Ephesians is not written to produce spiritual striving.
It is written to produce grounded confidence.
</p>

<p>
Read slowly.
Let Paul’s repeated emphasis land:
<strong>in Christ, you are already blessed, already brought near, already included.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Then let the “walk” sections do their work —
not as burdens, but as the natural shape of the new humanity.
</p>
