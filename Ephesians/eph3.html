<h1>Ephesians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 3 — The Mystery Revealed and the Indwelling Christ</h2>

<h3>The Stewardship of the Mystery</h3>

<p>
For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—
surely you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,
how the mystery was made known to me by revelation,
as I have already written briefly.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:1–3)</a>
</p>

<p>
When you read this, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
which was not made known to people in other generations
as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:4–5)</a>
</p>

<p>
This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs,
members of the same body,
and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Purpose of the Gospel</h3>

<p>
I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace,
given to me through the working of His power.
Though I am less than the least of all the saints,
this grace was given to me:
to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery
hidden for ages in God, who created all things.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:7–9)</a>
</p>

<p>
This was so that now,
through the church,
the manifold wisdom of God might be made known
to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realm,
according to the eternal purpose He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:10–11)</a>
</p>

<p>
In Him we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
So I ask you not to lose heart over my sufferings for you,
which are your glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:12–13)</a>
</p>

<h3>Prayer for Inner Strength and Fullness</h3>

<p>
For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named.
I pray that He would grant you,
according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in your inner being,
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:14–17)</a>
</p>

<p>
Being rooted and grounded in love,
you may be able to comprehend,
together with all the saints,
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:18–19)</a>
</p>

<p>
Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more
than all we ask or imagine,
according to the power at work within us,
to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:20–21)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 3</h2>

<h3>1) Mystery is revealed reality, not secret knowledge</h3>
<p>
Paul uses “mystery” the Hebrew way: something once hidden in God’s plan,
now openly disclosed.
It is not mystical insight for elites.
It is public truth with covenant consequences.
The New Creation is not speculation — it is revelation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:3–5)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) The heart of the mystery is shared inheritance</h3>
<p>
Paul defines the mystery plainly:
Gentiles are fellow heirs, one body, and co-participants.
Not guests.
Not junior partners.
This destroys every theology that preserves ethnic, ritual, or spiritual superiority.
If inheritance is shared, hierarchy collapses.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Grace produces service, not status</h3>
<p>
Paul refuses to turn revelation into ego.
The mystery entrusted to him made him a servant.
This guards the New Creation from celebrity spirituality.
Authority in the Kingdom expresses itself through service.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:7–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) The church is God’s announcement to the powers</h3>
<p>
The manifold wisdom of God is not primarily displayed through argument,
but through a reconciled people.
The existence of one new humanity proclaims that the old order has ended.
The “powers” are exposed as disarmed when their dividing work no longer holds.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Bold access replaces fear-based religion</h3>
<p>
Access language is temple language.
Paul says believers already possess it.
Confidence replaces caution because Christ has removed every barrier.
Any spirituality that trains people to approach God nervously
is out of step with Ephesians 3.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:12)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) Suffering does not negate fulfillment</h3>
<p>
Paul is imprisoned, yet he says his sufferings serve their glory.
Fulfillment does not mean comfort-only existence.
It means purpose is no longer threatened by hardship.
The New Creation advances even through weakness.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:13)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) “Christ dwelling in hearts” completes temple theology</h3>
<p>
Paul prays not for Christ to visit, but to dwell.
This is permanent residence language.
The indwelling Christ replaces all external sacred space.
God’s fullness is no longer housed in buildings or systems,
but in a Spirit-filled people.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:16–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) God’s fullness is meant to be experienced, not deferred</h3>
<p>
“To be filled with all the fullness of God” is not exaggeration.
It is New Creation reality.
The prayer assumes this fullness is accessible now,
not reserved for another age.
Knowing Christ’s love is not academic —
it is participatory and communal.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:18–19)</a>
</p>

<h3>9) God’s power is already at work within the community</h3>
<p>
Paul closes by locating divine power within us,
not waiting to arrive from outside.
The glory of God is expressed “in the church and in Christ Jesus”
through all generations.
This is not future hope —
it is ongoing New Creation manifestation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:20–21)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 3 moves the focus inward:
from reconciled humanity to indwelling presence.
The mystery is not merely that Gentiles are included —
it is that God now lives in His people,
and the world must reckon with that reality.
