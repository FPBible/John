<h1>Ephesians</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3 — The Mystery Made Visible</h2>

<p><em>
Ephesians 3 explains a mystery that had already been revealed —
not a plan still unfolding, but one now made visible in Christ and His people.
</em></p>

<h3>The Stewardship of Grace</h3>

<p>
For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you who are from the nations —
assuming you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,
how the mystery was made known to me by revelation,
as I have written briefly before.
When you read this,
you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:1–4)</a>
</p>

<p>
This mystery was not made known to people in previous generations
as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
that those from the nations are fellow heirs,
members of the same body,
and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:5–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Mystery Defined</h3>

<p>
Of this gospel I was made a servant
according to the gift of God’s grace given to me
by the working of His power.
To me — the very least of all the saints —
this grace was given:
to announce to the nations
the unsearchable riches of Christ,
and to bring to light for everyone
what is the administration of the mystery
hidden for ages in God who created all things.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:7–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>Made Known Through the Church</h3>

<p>
So that now,
through the church,
the manifold wisdom of God
might be made known
to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realm.
This was according to the purpose of the ages,
which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have boldness and confident access
through faithfulness to Him.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:10–12)</a>
</p>

<p>
So I ask you not to lose heart over my sufferings for you,
which are your glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:13)</a>
</p>

<h3>Prayer for Inner Strength</h3>

<p>
For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that according to the riches of His glory
He may grant you to be strengthened with power
through His Spirit in the inner person,
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith,
that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
may have strength to grasp with all the saints
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:14–19)</a>
</p>

<h3>Doxology: God at Work Now</h3>

<p>
Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly
than all that we ask or think,
according to the power at work within us,
to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
throughout all generations of the New Covenant age,
forever and ever. Amen.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:20–21)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Ephesians 3</h2>

<h3>1) Mystery means “once hidden, now revealed”</h3>
<p>
Paul uses “mystery” to describe something concealed under the old covenant
and now openly displayed.
It is not mystical ambiguity.
It is historical disclosure.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:3–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) The church is the message</h3>
<p>
God does not merely send information to the powers —
He sends a people.
A reconciled, multi-ethnic body is the evidence
that the old divisions have ended.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) “Heavenly rulers” are covenant authorities, not sci-fi villains</h3>
<p>
Paul speaks into a world of religious and political powers.
Their authority is relativised by Christ’s reign
and exposed by the existence of the church.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:10–11)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Access replaces distance</h3>
<p>
Boldness before God is not a future reward.
It is the defining feature of New Covenant life.
The curtain is gone.
Access is normal.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:12)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Fullness is participatory, not postponed</h3>
<p>
Paul prays believers be filled with the fullness of God —
not someday, but now.
This is relational saturation, not cosmic expansion.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EPH03.htm">(Eph 3:19)</a>
</p>

<p>
Ephesians 3 turns theology inside out:
the mystery is revealed,
the purpose accomplished,
and the wisdom of God made visible
through a living, reconciled people.
