  <h1>Gospel of John</h1>

  <h2>Chapter 9 — From Blindness to Sight: Judgment in the Present</h2>

  <h3>1) The Question Is Wrong</h3>
  <p>
    The disciples saw a blind man and asked the standard religious question: “Who sinned—him or his parents?”
    Jesus refused the blame-game. He reframed it: this is about God’s work being revealed, not about assigning guilt.
    And He pressed urgency: “We must work while it is day; night is coming.”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:1–5)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    That “day/night” line isn’t poetic filler. It’s covenant timing language. Light is present in Him; the old world is running out of road.
  </p>

  <h3>2) Mud, Washing, and New Creation Sight</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus made mud, put it on the man’s eyes, and told him to wash in Siloam (“Sent”).
    He washed—and he came back seeing.
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:6–7)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is creation imagery on purpose. The point is not spectacle. The point is: sight comes from the Sent One, not from the system.
  </p>

  <h3>3) The Crowd Can’t Process a Changed Man</h3>
  <p>
    Neighbours argued whether it was really him. He kept it simple: “I am the one.”
    When they asked “how,” he told them exactly what happened—no spin, no religious marketing.
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:8–12)</a>
  </p>

  <h3>4) Sabbath: Where Life Is Called “Illegal”</h3>
  <p>
    Because it was done on the Sabbath, they dragged him into an investigation.
    Some said Jesus couldn’t be from God because He “broke the Sabbath.”
    Others couldn’t deny what happened.
    The result: division.
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:13–16)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    When a tradition becomes an idol, it starts calling mercy “lawbreaking.”
  </p>

  <h3>5) Parents Under Pressure</h3>
  <p>
    The authorities interrogated the parents. They confirmed he was born blind—but refused to explain more.
    They were afraid of being put out of the synagogue.
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:18–23)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    That fear tells you everything: this wasn’t neutral “theology.” This was a power structure guarding itself.
  </p>

  <h3>6) The Healed Man Becomes the Judge</h3>
  <p>
    They demanded he condemn Jesus: “We know this man is a sinner.”
    He answered with the line religion can’t survive: “I was blind; now I see.”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:24–25)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    When they pushed again, he pushed back harder: “Why do you want to hear it again—do you want to become His disciples too?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:26–27)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    He then exposed their ignorance: you claim to represent God, yet you can’t recognise God’s work when it’s right in your face.
    “If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:30–33)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Their response was pure contempt: “You were born in sins—are you teaching us?”
    And they threw him out.
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:34)</a>
  </p>

  <h3>7) Jesus Finds the Cast-Out</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus went and found him. That’s not sentimental—it's the whole point.
    The system expels; the Shepherd gathers.
    Jesus revealed Himself, and the man believed and worshiped.
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:35–38)</a>
  </p>

  <h3>8) Judgment Is Now</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus said He came for judgment: so the blind may see, and those who claim sight become blind.
    The Pharisees asked, “Are we blind too?”
    Jesus answered: “Now you say, ‘We see’—your sin remains.”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm">(John 9:39–41)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s the punchline: judgment is exposure. Light doesn’t just comfort; it reveals what’s false.
  </p>

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 9</h2>

  <h3>1) “Blind from birth” reads like covenant blindness</h3>
  <p>
    John isn’t just telling a miracle story. He’s showing what Israel’s leaders looked like under the old order:
    confident, credentialed, and blind—because they’re loyal to the system, not to God.
  </p>

  <h3>2) Sabbath conflict is a leadership indictment</h3>
  <p>
    The Sabbath wasn’t the problem—hard hearts were. When mercy is treated as criminal, you’re watching a regime defending itself.
    John 9 is a courtroom drama where the wrong people are on trial.
  </p>

  <h3>3) Expulsion from the synagogue is the “cost of sight”</h3>
  <p>
    The man loses social safety and religious status the moment he tells the truth.
    That’s not an accident—John is showing how the old world policed access and punished testimony.
  </p>

  <h3>4) Judgment happens when Light arrives</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus doesn’t define judgment mainly as future scheduling. He defines it as present confrontation:
    truth exposes blindness, and refusal hardens it. That’s why “We see” becomes the self-condemning line.
  </p>

  <h3>5) John 9 sets up John 10</h3>
  <p>
    The cast-out man is exactly the kind of sheep the Shepherd gathers. John 10 is not a random new topic.
    It’s the direct answer to John 9: corrupt “shepherds” expel; the true Shepherd secures.
