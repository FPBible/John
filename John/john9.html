  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 9 — Sight for the New Creation, Blindness for the Old World</h2>

  <h3>The Man Born Blind</h3>

  <p>
    As Jesus passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.
    His disciples asked Him,
    “Rabbi, who sinned — this man or his parents — that he was born blind?”
    Jesus answered,
    “Neither this man nor his parents sinned.
    This happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.
    We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day.
    Night is coming when no one can work.
    While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:1–5)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After saying this, He spat on the ground,
    made mud with the saliva,
    and anointed the man’s eyes with the mud.
    He said to him,
    “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam”
    (which means “Sent”).
    So he went, washed, and came back seeing
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:6–7)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Division Among the Neighbours</h3>

  <p>
    The neighbours and those who had seen him before as a beggar said,
    “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”
    Some said, “It is he.”
    Others said, “No, but he is like him.”
    But he said, “I am the one.”
    They asked him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”
    He answered,
    “The man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me,
    ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’
    So I went and washed, and I received sight”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:8–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They asked him, “Where is He?”
    He said, “I don’t know.”
    They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:12–13)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Pharisees Investigate</h3>

  <p>
    Now the day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath.
    So the Pharisees asked him again how he received his sight.
    He said,
    “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
    Some of the Pharisees said,
    “This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.”
    Others said,
    “How can a sinner do such signs?”
    And there was a division among them
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:14–16)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said again to the blind man,
    “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?”
    He said, “He is a prophet.”
    The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and received sight,
    until they called the parents of the man who had received sight
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:17–18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They asked them,
    “Is this your son, who you say was born blind?
    How then does he now see?”
    His parents answered,
    “We know this is our son and that he was born blind.
    But how he now sees we do not know,
    or who opened his eyes, we do not know.
    Ask him; he is of age.”
    His parents said this because they feared the Jews,
    for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ
    would be put out of the synagogue
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:19–22)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Spiritual Blindness Exposed</h3>

  <p>
    So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said,
    “Give glory to God.
    We know that this man is a sinner.”
    He answered,
    “Whether He is a sinner, I do not know.
    One thing I do know:
    though I was blind, now I see.”
    They said, “What did He do to you?
    How did He open your eyes?”
    He answered,
    “I told you already, and you did not listen.
    Why do you want to hear it again?
    Do you also want to become His disciples?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:24–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They reviled him, saying,
    “You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
    We know that God has spoken to Moses,
    but as for this man, we don’t know where He comes from.”
    The man answered,
    “This is remarkable!
    You don’t know where He comes from,
    yet He opened my eyes.
    We know that God does not listen to sinners,
    but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will,
    God listens to him.
    Never since the world began has it been heard
    that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
    If this man were not from God,
    He could do nothing”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:28–33)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They answered him,
    “You were born entirely in sins,
    and are you teaching us?”
    And they cast him out
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:34)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>True Sight and True Judgment</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus heard that they had cast him out,
    and when He found him, He said,
    “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
    He answered,
    “And who is He, sir, that I may believe in Him?”
    Jesus said,
    “You have seen Him,
    and it is He who is speaking with you.”
    He said,
    “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:35–38)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “For judgment I came into this world,
    so that those who do not see may see,
    and those who see may become blind.”
    Some of the Pharisees near Him heard these things and said,
    “Are we also blind?”
    Jesus said to them,
    “If you were blind, you would have no sin.
    But now that you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:39–41)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 9</h2>

  <h3>1. Blind from birth = Israel born under the old covenant</h3>
  <p>
    The man’s blindness is not blamed on personal sin
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:3)</a>.
    He represents Israel born into a system unable to see clearly.
    The law could diagnose blindness but could not heal it.
    Jesus arrives as the Light who gives sight — a New Creation act.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Mud and washing echo creation and sending</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus forms mud from the ground,
    echoing creation imagery
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/GEN02.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Gen 2:7)</a>.
    The Pool of Siloam means “Sent”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:7)</a>.
    Sight comes through obedience to the One sent by the Father.
    This is New Creation language, not magic.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Sabbath controversy exposes the old system</h3>
  <p>
    Healing on the Sabbath again triggers outrage
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:14)</a>.
    The old covenant guardians value rule-keeping over restoration.
    Jesus shows that true Sabbath is restoration itself.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The healed man grows in testimony</h3>
  <p>
    His confession develops:
    “the man called Jesus” →
    “He is a prophet” →
    “He is from God” →
    “Lord, I believe”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:11)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:17)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:33)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:38)</a>.
    This is the journey from old identity into New Creation faith.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Cast out of the synagogue = cast out of the old world</h3>
  <p>
    Being expelled from the synagogue
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:34)</a>
    is not loss — it is liberation.
    Jesus immediately finds him.
    Fellowship with Christ replaces institutional belonging.
    This is the shift from old covenant structures to New Creation community.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Judgment as revelation, not future threat</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says,
    “For judgment I came into this world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN09.htm#v39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 9:39)</a>.
    Judgment here is exposure:
    those claiming sight are revealed as blind;
    those admitting blindness receive sight.
    This judgment is already active in Jesus’ ministry,
    intensifying toward the end of the old age.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 9 is not mainly about eyesight.
    It is about an age-change.
    The New Creation opens eyes,
    while the old covenant system hardens itself into blindness.
    The question Jesus presses is simple:
    do you see — or do you only think you do?
