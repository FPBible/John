      <h1>John 9</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">From Blindness to Sight — Judgment in the Present (Fulfilled / New Creation lens)</p>
    </header>

    <section class="card" aria-label="Chapter text">
      <p class="section-title">1) The Question Is Wrong</p>
      <p class="verse">As Jesus passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.</p>
      <p class="verse">His disciples asked, “Rabbi, who sinned—this man or his parents—that he was born blind?”</p>
      <p class="verse">Jesus answered: “You’re asking the wrong question. This is not about blame. This is about revelation.</p>
      <p class="verse">This man exists so that God’s work may be made visible in him.</p>
      <p class="verse">While it is day, we must do the works of the One who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work.</p>
      <p class="verse">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>FP note:</strong> “Blind from birth” functions like covenant blindness—Israel under the old order, unable to see clearly.
        “Night coming” signals the closing of that age, when the old system loses its power to define reality.
      </div>

      <hr />

      <p class="section-title">2) Creation Revisited</p>
      <p class="verse">Jesus spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and smeared it on the man’s eyes.</p>
      <p class="verse">He said, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which means <em>Sent</em>).</p>
      <p class="verse">The man went, washed—and came back seeing.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>FP note:</strong> Mud + eyes echoes creation imagery. This isn’t mere “proof” — it’s a lived sign of new creation:
        sight comes by the <em>Sent One</em>, not by the temple’s control system.
      </div>

      <hr />

      <p class="section-title">3) Religion Can’t Handle Change</p>
      <p class="verse">The neighbors argued: “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”</p>
      <p class="verse">Some said yes. Others said no—just someone like him.</p>
      <p class="verse">He said, “I am the one.”</p>
      <p class="verse">They asked, “How were your eyes opened?”</p>
      <p class="verse">He answered plainly: “The man called Jesus put mud on my eyes. I washed. Now I see.”</p>
      <p class="verse">They brought him to the Pharisees—because it happened on a Sabbath.</p>

      <hr />

      <p class="section-title">4) Sabbath vs Reality</p>
      <p class="verse">The Pharisees questioned him again: “How did you receive sight?”</p>
      <p class="verse">He told them the same thing: “He put mud on my eyes. I washed. I see.”</p>
      <p class="verse">Some said, “This man is not from God—He breaks the Sabbath.”</p>
      <p class="verse">Others said, “How can a sinner do signs like this?” And division followed.</p>
      <p class="verse">They asked the man again, “What do you say about Him?”</p>
      <p class="verse">He said, “He is a prophet.”</p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>FP note:</strong> The Sabbath had become an idol. When life appears, a threatened system calls it “illegal.”
      </div>

      <hr />

      <p class="section-title">5) Parents Fear the System</p>
      <p class="verse">They questioned his parents.</p>
      <p class="verse">They said: “Yes, he is our son. Yes, he was born blind.</p>
      <p class="verse">How he sees now—we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age.”</p>
      <p class="verse">They said this because they feared being expelled from the synagogue.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>FP note:</strong> Excommunication was real leverage. The system punished truth-tellers to preserve control.
      </div>

      <hr />

      <p class="section-title">6) The Blind Man Grows Bolder</p>
      <p class="verse">They summoned the man again: “Give glory to God. We know this man is a sinner.”</p>
      <p class="verse">He replied: “Whether He is a sinner, I don’t know. One thing I know: I was blind. Now I see.”</p>
      <p class="verse">They pressed him again.</p>
      <p class="verse">He answered: “I’ve already told you. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become His disciples too?”</p>
      <p class="verse">They insulted him.</p>
      <p class="verse">He said: “This is astonishing. You don’t know where He comes from—yet He opened my eyes.</p>
      <p class="verse">God does not listen to those who cling to sin, but to those who do His will.</p>
      <p class="verse">Never has anyone opened the eyes of one born blind. If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.”</p>
      <p class="verse">They answered: “You were born entirely in sin—and you dare teach us?”</p>
      <p class="verse">And they cast him out.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>FP note:</strong> This is judgment in action: the healed are expelled; the blind keep their titles.
        The “trial” exposes who is actually loyal to God.
      </div>

      <hr />

      <p class="section-title">7) True Sight Revealed</p>
      <p class="verse">Jesus found him and asked: “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</p>
      <p class="verse">He said, “Who is He, sir, that I may believe?”</p>
      <p class="verse">Jesus said: “You have seen Him. He is the one speaking with you.”</p>
      <p class="verse">He said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped Him.</p>

      <hr />

      <p class="section-title">8) Judgment Is Now</p>
      <p class="verse">Jesus said: “For judgment I came into this world—so that those who do not see may see, and those who think they see may become blind.”</p>
      <p class="verse">Some Pharisees heard this and asked, “Are we blind too?”</p>
      <p class="verse">Jesus answered: “If you were blind, you would have no guilt. But now you say, ‘We see.’ Your guilt remains.”</p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>FP hammer:</strong> Judgment isn’t postponed. It happens when Light confronts a system.
        Seeing isn’t eyesight—it’s allegiance.
