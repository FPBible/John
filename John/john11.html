<h1>John 11</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Lazarus and the Delay (John 11:1–16)</h2>

<p>There was a man named Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. Lazarus became sick, and the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, “Lord, the one You love is sick.”</p>

<p>When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness is not leading to death, but is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus, yet He remained where He was for two more days.</p>

<p>After this delay, Jesus said to His disciples that they were going back to Judea. The disciples warned Him of danger, but Jesus answered that He must walk in the light of the day. He then said plainly, “Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going to awaken him.”</p>

<p>When they misunderstood, Jesus told them clearly, “Lazarus has died.” Thomas said to the others, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — “I Am the Resurrection and the Life” (John 11:17–37)</h2>

<p>When Jesus arrived, Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Many Jews had come to comfort Martha and Mary.</p>

<p>Martha went out to meet Jesus and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. Even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask.” Jesus told her, “Your brother will rise again.”</p>

<p>Martha replied with traditional expectation, saying she knew he would rise in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus answered, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die.”</p>

<p>Martha confessed that He was the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming into the world. Mary then came, weeping, and Jesus was deeply moved. He wept.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Lazarus Raised (John 11:38–44)</h2>

<p>Jesus came to the tomb, a cave with a stone laid against it. He ordered the stone to be removed. Martha objected, saying there would be an odor, for Lazarus had been dead four days.</p>

<p>Jesus replied that if she believed, she would see the glory of God. He prayed aloud, then cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”</p>

<p>The man who had died came out, bound hand and foot. Jesus said, “Unbind him, and let him go.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Plot to Kill Jesus (John 11:45–57)</h2>

<p>Many believed because of what they saw, but others reported it to the Pharisees. The chief priests and Pharisees gathered the council, fearing that if Jesus continued, the Romans would take away their place and nation.</p>

<p>Caiaphas, the high priest, said that it was better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to perish. John explains that he spoke prophetically, though he did not understand it.</p>

<p>From that day on, they planned to kill Jesus. He withdrew to a region near the wilderness as Passover approached.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Disciples, grieving Jews, and Israel’s leadership</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> Resurrection language is brought into the present as a sign that covenant death is about to be overturned</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> This sign forces a decision: life in the Son, or preservation of a dying system.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) Lazarus represents Israel in covenant death</h3>
<p>Four days in the tomb emphasizes finality. Lazarus embodies a people beyond self-recovery, trapped in death under the Law.</p>

<h3>2) Delay is deliberate</h3>
<p>Jesus allows the situation to become humanly irreversible so the sign cannot be minimized. Resurrection will not be mistaken for recovery.</p>

<h3>3) What ended</h3>
<p>Future-only resurrection hope, Law-based identity, and temple-centered mediation of life are exposed as insufficient.</p>

<h3>4) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Resurrection is no longer an event on a calendar; it is a Person. Life now flows from union with the Son.</p>

<h3>5) “I am the resurrection” is covenant present tense</h3>
<p>Jesus does not point Martha forward in time — He points her to Himself. Resurrection life is standing in front of her.</p>

<h3>6) The unbinding is critical</h3>
<p>Lazarus is alive before he is unbound. Life comes first; freedom follows. This mirrors Israel being raised and then released from death-structures.</p>

<h3>7) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>This sign accelerates the final conflict. Resurrection life confronts the old order, leading directly to the cross and culminating in the removal of the temple system in AD 70.</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>Resurrection is not something you wait for — it is Someone you live in. Life has already spoken your name. Freedom is learning to walk unbound.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Where might God already have given life, while you are still waiting for the stone to move?</p>
