<h1>John 11</h1>
<h2>Resurrection and Life</h2>

<p>
John 11 stands at the theological centre of the Gospel.
It is not a lesson about the mechanics of future resurrection,
but a decisive sign revealing who Jesus is
and what His presence means for a death-bound covenant world.
</p>

<h3>Delay That Reveals Purpose</h3>

<p>
When Lazarus falls ill, Jesus does not rush to prevent death.
The delay is intentional.
The sign that follows is not about compassion alone,
but revelation.
</p>

<p>
Jesus frames the event from the outset:
this sickness will not end in death,
but in the unveiling of God’s glory.
What is about to happen will expose
the nature of life in the Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:1–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>Life Operates by a Different Clock</h3>

<p>
Jesus speaks of walking in the light.
Those who walk in the light do not stumble,
because their life is not governed by fear of death.
</p>

<p>
Death does not dictate Jesus’ actions.
Life does.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:7–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>“Lazarus Has Fallen Asleep”</h3>

<p>
Jesus refers to Lazarus’ death as sleep.
The language is deliberate.
Death is not ultimate.
It is temporary and subordinate
to the life He brings.
</p>

<p>
The disciples misunderstand,
revealing how deeply ingrained
their assumptions still are.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:11–16)</a>
</p>

<h3>Conflicting Expectations</h3>

<p>
Martha expresses a common belief:
resurrection is something that happens
“on the last day.”
</p>

<p>
Her statement reflects the prevailing expectation —
a future event detached from present reality.
Jesus does not affirm the expectation.
He reframes it.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:21–24)</a>
</p>

<h3>“I Am the Resurrection and the Life”</h3>

<p>
Jesus does not point Martha to a future moment.
He points her to Himself.
“I am the resurrection and the life.”
</p>

<p>
Resurrection is no longer an event on a timeline.
It is a person.
Life is encountered in relationship with Him,
not postponed to the end of history.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:25–26)</a>
</p>

  <strong>Clarification — Resurrection in John 11</strong><br />
  Jesus does not redefine resurrection as a future-only occurrence.
  He reveals resurrection as present life in the Son.
  Lazarus functions as a sign —
  not a resurrection timetable —
  demonstrating that covenant death is being overrun by life in Christ.<br /><br />
  See:
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/ezekiel37.html">Ezekiel 37 — Resurrection as Restoration</a> |
  <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/resurrection/1cor15.html">1 Corinthians 15 — Resurrection and Victory</a>
</div>

<h3>Grief Meets Authority</h3>

<p>
Jesus enters fully into human sorrow.
He weeps.
This is not detachment.
It is compassion without helplessness.
</p>

<p>
His grief does not negate His authority over death.
It reveals the depth of His engagement
with those He has come to give life to.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:32–37)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Sign: Life Commands Death</h3>

<p>
At the tomb, Jesus does not pray for power.
He commands.
</p>

<p>
Lazarus comes out —
still wrapped in grave clothes.
The sign is intentionally incomplete.
Life has been restored,
but the old wrappings remain.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:38–44)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>The Meaning of the Sign</strong><br />
  Lazarus emerges alive but still bound.
  This mirrors the covenant moment:
  life has arrived,
  but the old order has not yet been fully removed.
  The sign points forward to the complete unbinding
  accomplished through Christ’s death, resurrection, and reign.
</div>

<h3>Life Provokes Judgment</h3>

<p>
The response is divided.
Some believe.
Others plot.
Life exposes allegiance.
</p>

<p>
From this moment,
the authorities move decisively toward Jesus’ death.
Ironically, the giver of life is condemned
by a system that cannot survive His presence.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN11.htm">(John 11:45–53)</a>
</p>
