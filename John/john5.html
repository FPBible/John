<h1>John 5</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Healing at Bethesda (John 5:1–18)</h2>

<p><strong>5:1–3</strong> After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Near the Sheep Gate was a pool called Bethesda, with five covered colonnades. In them lay many who were sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed.</p>

<p><strong>5:5–7</strong> One man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years. Jesus saw him lying there and said to him, “Do you want to be made well?” The man answered, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am coming, someone else steps down before me.”</p>

<p><strong>5:8–9</strong> Jesus said to him, “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.” Immediately the man was made well, picked up his mat, and walked. Now it was the Sabbath.</p>

<p><strong>5:10–13</strong> The Jews said to the man who was healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.” He answered, “The One who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” They asked who it was, but the man did not know, because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.</p>

<p><strong>5:14–15</strong> Later Jesus found him in the temple and said, “See, you have been made well. Do not continue in sin, so that nothing worse happens to you.” The man went and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</p>

<p><strong>5:16–18</strong> For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I also am working.” This was why they were seeking all the more to kill Him—because He was not only breaking the Sabbath, but was also calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.</p>

<h2>Paraphrase — Authority, Life, and Judgment (John 5:19–30)</h2>

<p><strong>5:19–20</strong> Jesus answered them, “Amen, amen, I tell you: the Son can do nothing from Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son likewise does. The Father loves the Son and shows Him all that He Himself is doing.”</p>

<p><strong>5:21–23</strong> “Just as the Father raises the dead and gives life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes. For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.”</p>

<p><strong>5:24</strong> “The one who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.”</p>

<p><strong>5:25</strong> “Amen, amen, I tell you: an hour is coming—and now is—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.”</p>

<p><strong>5:26–27</strong> “Just as the Father has life in Himself, so He granted the Son to have life in Himself. And He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.”</p>

<p><strong>5:28–30</strong> “Do not be amazed at this, because an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice and come out—those who did good to a resurrection of life, and those who practiced evil to a resurrection of judgment. I can do nothing from Myself. As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”</p><hr />

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) The man at Bethesda represents covenant paralysis</h3>
<p>Thirty-eight years echoes Israel’s wilderness wandering (Deut 2:14). This is not coincidence. The man is trapped inside a system that cannot heal him. Jesus does not help him into the pool — He bypasses the system entirely.</p>

<h3>2) Sabbath healing exposes the end of the old rest</h3>
<p>The Sabbath was meant to point to God’s rest. By healing on the Sabbath, Jesus declares that true rest is arriving in Him. The old covenant rest is insufficient and is being replaced by living restoration.</p>

<h3>3) “My Father is working” announces divine authority</h3>
<p>God’s work did not stop at Sinai. Jesus claims equality with God, not as blasphemy, but as revelation. This statement detonates the old religious framework.</p>

<h3>4) Resurrection language is covenantal, not biological</h3>
<p>“The dead hearing His voice” is not about corpses popping out of graves thousands of years later. It is prophetic language describing the awakening of a people trapped in sin, law, and death. This resurrection begins <em>now</em>.</p>

<h3>5) Judgment is delegated and historical</h3>
<p>The Son executes judgment within history. This aligns with Daniel 7:13–14 — authority given to the Son of Man. John 5 points forward to covenant judgment culminating in AD70.</p>

<h3>6) “Tombs” represent the death-world of the Law</h3>
<p>Israel under the Law is repeatedly described as dead (Ezek 37). The “tombs” Jesus references are the covenant structures holding people in death. His voice brings them out into life.</p>
