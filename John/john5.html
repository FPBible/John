<h1>John 5</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Healing at Bethesda (John 5:1–18)</h2>

<p><strong>5:1–3</strong> After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now in Jerusalem, by the Sheep Gate, there is a pool called Bethesda, with five covered porches. In these lay many who were sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed.</p>

<p><strong>5:4</strong> (Some manuscripts add a line about an angel stirring the water. John’s point does not depend on that tradition.)</p>

<p><strong>5:5–7</strong> A man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years. Jesus saw him lying there and said, “Do you want to be made well?” The man answered, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I’m coming, someone else steps down before me.”</p>

<p><strong>5:8–9</strong> Jesus said, “Get up. Pick up your mat and walk.” Immediately the man was made well, picked up his mat, and walked. Now it was the Sabbath.</p>

<p><strong>5:10–13</strong> The Jews said, “It’s the Sabbath. It’s not lawful for you to carry your mat.” He answered, “The One who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” They asked who it was, but the healed man didn’t know—Jesus had slipped away in the crowd.</p>

<p><strong>5:14–15</strong> Later Jesus found him in the temple and said, “See, you have been made well. Don’t return to sin, so that nothing worse happens to you.” The man went and told the Jews it was Jesus who made him well.</p>

<p><strong>5:16–18</strong> For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus—because He did these things on the Sabbath. But Jesus answered, “My Father is working until now, and I also am working.” This made them seek to kill Him, because He was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.</p>

<h2>Paraphrase — The Son’s Authority (John 5:19–30)</h2>

<p><strong>5:19–20</strong> Jesus said, “Amen, amen, I tell you: the Son can do nothing from Himself, but only what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise. The Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He Himself is doing.”</p>

<p><strong>5:21–23</strong> “Just as the Father raises the dead and gives life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.”</p>

<p><strong>5:24</strong> “The one who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.”</p>

<p><strong>5:25–27</strong> “An hour is coming—and now is—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave the Son to have life in Himself, and He gave Him authority to execute judgment.”</p>

<p><strong>5:28–30</strong> “Don’t be amazed at this, because an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear His voice and come out—those who did good to a resurrection of life, and those who practiced evil to a resurrection of judgment. I0
