  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 3 — Born from Above into the New Creation</h2>

  <h3>Nicodemus and the New Birth from Above</h3>

  <p>
    There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
    He came to Jesus at night and said,
    “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God,
    for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:1–2)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered him,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you, unless someone is born from above,
    he cannot see the kingdom of God”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:3)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nicodemus said to Him,
    “How can a man be born when he is old?
    Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:4)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you, unless someone is born of water and Spirit,
    he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
    What is born of the flesh is flesh;
    what is born of the Spirit is spirit
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:5–6)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’
    The wind blows where it wants, and you hear its sound,
    but you don’t know where it comes from or where it’s going.
    So it is with everyone born of the Spirit”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:7–8)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nicodemus said to Him, “How can these things be?”
    Jesus answered him,
    “You are Israel’s teacher, and you don’t understand these things?
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:9–10)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Amen, amen, I tell you,
    we speak what we know and testify to what we have seen,
    but you do not receive our testimony.
    If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe,
    how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:11–12)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    No one has gone up into heaven except the One who came down from heaven —
    the Son of Man
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:13)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Serpent Lifted Up and the Son of Man Exalted</h3>

  <p>
    “Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
    even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
    so that everyone believing in Him may have eternal life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:14–15)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/NUM21.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Num 21:8–9)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the wilderness story, the people gazed at the lifted bronze serpent and lived
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/NUM21.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Num 21:8–9)</a>.
    In the New Creation story, humanity looks to the crucified and risen Son of Man and shares His life.
  </p>

  <p>
    “For God so loved the world that He gave His only born Son,
    that whoever believes into Him should not perish but have eternal life.
    For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world,
    but that the world might be saved through Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:16–17)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The one trusting in Him is not condemned;
    but the one not trusting has already been condemned,
    because he has not trusted in the name of the only born Son of God
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the judgment:
    the Light has come into the world,
    and people loved the darkness rather than the Light,
    because their works were evil
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:19)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For everyone practicing what is worthless hates the Light
    and does not come to the Light, so that their works will not be exposed.
    But the one doing the truth comes to the Light,
    so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:20–21)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In New Creation terms:
    the Light has already arrived;
    judgment is already in motion;
    the separation is between those who cling to the old world of darkness
    and those who step into the unveiled reality of God in Christ.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus and John — The Old Order Fades, the New One Increases</h3>

  <p>
    After these things, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside,
    and He spent time with them there and was baptising
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:22)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    John also was baptising at Aenon near Salim,
    because there was plenty of water there,
    and people were coming and being baptised.
    For John had not yet been thrown into prison
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:23–24)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then a dispute arose between some of John’s disciples and a Jew
    about ceremonial cleansing.
    They came to John and said,
    “Rabbi, the One who was with you across the Jordan,
    the One you testified about — look, He is baptising,
    and everyone is going to Him!”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:25–26)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    John answered,
    “A person can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.
    You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am sent before Him’
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:27–28)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The one who has the bride is the bridegroom;
    the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens for him,
    rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice.
    So this joy of mine is complete.
    He must increase, but I must decrease
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:29–30)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In other words:
    John’s ministry belongs to the old world fading out;
    Jesus’ ministry belongs to the New Creation world coming fully into view.
  </p>

  <h3>From Above vs From the Earth</h3>

  <p>
    “The One who comes from above is above all.
    The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from the earth.
    The One who comes from heaven is above all
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:31)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He testifies to what He has seen and heard,
    yet no one receives His testimony.
    The one who has received His testimony has certified that God is true
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:32–33)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God,
    for He gives the Spirit without measure
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:34)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.
    The one trusting in the Son has eternal life;
    but the one refusing to trust the Son will not see life,
    but the wrath of God remains upon him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:35–36)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fulfilled lens:
    the old-covenant world remains under wrath;
    those who cling to it share its fate.
    Those who trust the Son share His life in the New Creation.
  </p>

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 3</h2>

  <h3>1. “Born from above” = New Covenant birth into the New Creation</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus doesn’t tell Nicodemus, “You need a second biological birth.”
    He speaks of being born “from above”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:3)</a>,
    by “water and Spirit”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:5)</a>.
    This is Ezekiel’s promised cleansing and new heart:
    washed and given the Spirit
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EZK36.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ezk 36:25–27)</a>.
    In a fulfilled frame, this is entrance into the New Covenant / New Creation world,
    not a ticket to a future realm.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Kingdom sight and entry are present realities in Christ</h3>
  <p>
    “Cannot see the kingdom of God” and “cannot enter the kingdom of God”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:3,5)</a>
    are not threats about some far-off era.
    They describe the present reality:
    without the Spirit’s new birth, Nicodemus cannot recognise or participate
    in the kingdom that is already breaking in through Jesus.
    The King is present; the kingdom is active; the issue is spiritual blindness versus Spirit-birth.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Bronze serpent: judgment and healing focused in the crucified Christ</h3>
  <p>
    The lifting up of the Son of Man
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:14–15)</a>
    mirrors the lifting up of the bronze serpent
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/NUM21.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Num 21:8–9)</a>.
    The poison of the old world’s rebellion is answered in the crucified Christ.
    Whoever looks to Him — trusts into Him — participates in the life of the New Creation now.
    This is not about a later escape from earth;
    it is about deliverance from the old Adamic / old covenant death system into Christ’s resurrection life.
  </p>

  <h3>4. “God so loved the world” is covenant fulfillment, not a future maybe</h3>
  <p>
    John 3:16–17 declares what God has done, not what He might one day do:
    God has already given the Son;
    the Son has already come, not to condemn the world but to save it
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:16–17)</a>.
    Judgment is not postponed to an undefined future;
    it is already at work in how people respond to the Light standing in front of them.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Judgment is present: “already condemned” vs “not condemned”</h3>
  <p>
    The one trusting in the Son “is not condemned,”
    while the one not trusting “has already been condemned”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:18)</a>.
    That language is present and perfect tense, not speculative.
    In the fulfilled lens, the crisis of judgment is concentrated in the coming of Christ
    and the transition from the old covenant age to the New Creation age.
    Those who cling to darkness stand under judgment;
    those who step into the Light live in the verdict of “no condemnation”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ROM08.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Rom 8:1)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Light vs darkness = New Creation vs old world</h3>
  <p>
    “The Light has come into the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:19)</a>
    is not future language — it’s done.
    The separation is between those who love darkness (the old order, hidden works, religious hypocrisy)
    and those who come to the Light (the unveiled reality of God in Christ).
    The New Creation is a realm of exposure and truth,
    where works are revealed as “done in God”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:21)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>7. “He must increase, I must decrease” = covenant shift</h3>
  <p>
    John the Baptist is not just being personally humble;
    he is announcing a covenant transition:
    his ministry belongs to the old era; Jesus’ belongs to the new
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:30)</a>.
    As Jesus increases, the old preparatory structures (law, prophets, temple system) decrease
    and finally pass away
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Heb 8:13)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Spirit without measure and wrath that remains</h3>
  <p>
    The Father gives the Spirit to the Son “without measure”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:34)</a>,
    and the Son shares this limitless Spirit-life with those who trust Him.
    The one trusting in the Son “has eternal life” — present tense —
    while the one refusing the Son remains under wrath
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN03.htm#v36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 3:36)</a>.
    In the fulfilled frame, the “wrath” is not God’s random rage;
    it is the covenantal consequence hanging over the old world,
    fully manifested in the judgment on that age.
    To stay in that system is to stay under wrath; to trust the Son is to live in the New Creation.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 3 shows that “new birth,” “eternal life,” “judgment,” and “wrath”
    are not mainly about a far future end of the universe,
    but about the decisive turning of the ages in Christ:
    the end of the old covenant world and the arrival of the New Creation.
