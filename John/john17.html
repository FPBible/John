  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 17 — Glory Shared and the World Made One</h2>

  <h3>Jesus Prays for Himself</h3>

  <p>
    When Jesus had spoken these words,
    He lifted His eyes to heaven and said,
    “Father, the hour has come.
    Glorify Your Son,
    so that the Son may glorify You.
    You have given Him authority over all flesh,
    to give eternal life
    to all whom You have given Him.
    And this is eternal life:
    that they know You,
    the only true God,
    and Jesus Christ whom You have sent”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:1–3)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I glorified You on earth,
    having finished the work
    that You gave Me to do.
    And now, Father,
    glorify Me in Your presence
    with the glory I had with You
    before the world existed”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:4–5)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus Prays for the Disciples</h3>

  <p>
    “I have revealed Your name
    to those You gave Me out of the world.
    They were Yours,
    and You gave them to Me,
    and they have kept Your word.
    Now they know
    that everything You have given Me
    comes from You.
    I have given them the words You gave Me,
    and they received them
    and truly knew that I came from You,
    and they believed that You sent Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:6–8)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I am praying for them.
    I am not praying for the world,
    but for those You have given Me,
    for they are Yours.
    All that is Mine is Yours,
    and Yours is Mine,
    and I am glorified in them.
    I am no longer in the world,
    but they are in the world,
    and I am coming to You.
    Holy Father,
    keep them in Your name,
    so that they may be one,
    just as We are one”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:9–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “While I was with them,
    I kept them in Your name.
    I guarded them,
    and none of them was lost
    except the son of destruction,
    so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
    Now I am coming to You,
    and I speak these things in the world
    so that they may have My joy
    made complete in themselves”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:12–13)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have given them Your word,
    and the world has hated them
    because they are not of the world,
    just as I am not of the world.
    I do not ask that You take them out of the world,
    but that You keep them from the evil one.
    They are not of the world,
    just as I am not of the world.
    Sanctify them in the truth;
    Your word is truth.
    As You sent Me into the world,
    so I have sent them into the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:14–18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “For their sake
    I set Myself apart,
    so that they also may be set apart in truth”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:19)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus Prays for All Who Will Believe</h3>

  <p>
    “I do not ask for these only,
    but also for those
    who will believe in Me through their word,
    so that they may all be one.
    As You, Father, are in Me,
    and I am in You,
    may they also be in Us,
    so that the world may believe
    that You sent Me.
    The glory You gave Me
    I have given to them,
    so that they may be one,
    just as We are one”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:20–22)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I in them,
    and You in Me,
    so that they may be brought to full unity.
    Then the world will know
    that You sent Me
    and loved them
    even as You loved Me.
    Father,
    I desire that those You have given Me
    may be with Me where I am,
    to see My glory,
    the glory You have given Me
    because You loved Me
    before the foundation of the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:23–24)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Righteous Father,
    though the world does not know You,
    I know You,
    and these know that You sent Me.
    I have made Your name known to them,
    and will continue to make it known,
    so that the love with which You loved Me
    may be in them,
    and I in them”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN17.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 17:25–26)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 17</h2>

  <h3>1. “The hour has come” signals consummation</h3>
  <p>
    In John, “the hour” is never vague.
    It is the decisive moment
    when the old world collapses
    and the new begins.
    This prayer stands at the threshold
    of cross, resurrection, and vindication —
    not anticipation, but arrival.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Eternal life is present relational participation</h3>
  <p>
    Eternal life is defined,
    not postponed.
    It is knowing the Father through the Son.
    This is covenant union now,
    not survival later.
  </p>

  <h3>3. “I have finished the work” is covenant certainty</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus speaks of completion
    before the cross,
    because covenantally
    the outcome is settled.
    History is about to catch up
    with what is already true.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The disciples are transferred, not extracted</h3>
  <p>
    They remain in the world geographically,
    but are no longer of it covenantally.
    The “world” here is the old covenant order,
    already judged and passing away.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Sanctification is covenant relocation</h3>
  <p>
    To be sanctified in truth
    is to be set apart
    from the old defining system
    and established in the revelation of the Son.
    This is identity, not behaviour management.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Oneness is shared divine life, not institutional unity</h3>
  <p>
    The unity Jesus prays for
    mirrors Father–Son union.
    It is participatory,
    ontological,
    and covenantal —
    not denominational alignment.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Glory is already shared</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says He has already given glory.
    New Creation people
    do not wait for access or honour.
    They live from shared life in the Son.
  </p>

  <h3>8. “With Me where I am” means present union</h3>
  <p>
    This is not future relocation.
    To be where He is
    is to share His standing with the Father.
    Union, not geography, is the point.
  </p>

  <h3>9. John 17 is the New Creation charter</h3>
  <p>
    This prayer defines identity,
    secures belonging,
    establishes unity,
    and anticipates the collapse of the old world.
    By AD 70,
    history confirmed what Jesus prayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 17 is not aspirational.
    It is constitutional.
    We do not pray toward it —
    we live from it.
  </p>
