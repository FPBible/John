  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 13 — The Way of the New Creation: Love and Servanthood</h2>

  <h3>Jesus Washes the Disciples’ Feet</h3>

  <p>
    Now before the Feast of the Passover,
    Jesus knew that His hour had come
    to depart out of this world to the Father.
    Having loved His own who were in the world,
    He loved them to the end
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:1)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    During supper,
    when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot,
    Simon’s son, to betray Him,
    Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands,
    and that He had come from God and was going to God,
    rose from supper,
    laid aside His outer garments,
    and took a towel and wrapped it around His waist.
    Then He poured water into a basin
    and began to wash the disciples’ feet
    and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:2–5)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He came to Simon Peter, who said,
    “Lord, do You wash my feet?”
    Jesus answered,
    “What I am doing you do not understand now,
    but afterward you will understand.”
    Peter said,
    “You shall never wash my feet!”
    Jesus answered,
    “If I do not wash you,
    you have no share with Me.”
    Simon Peter said,
    “Lord, not my feet only,
    but also my hands and my head!”
    Jesus said,
    “The one who has bathed does not need to wash,
    except for his feet,
    but is completely clean.
    And you are clean,
    but not all of you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:6–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>A New Pattern of Life</h3>

  <p>
    When He had washed their feet and put on His outer garments
    and resumed His place,
    He said,
    “Do you understand what I have done to you?
    You call Me Teacher and Lord,
    and you are right, for so I am.
    If I then, your Lord and Teacher,
    have washed your feet,
    you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
    For I have given you an example,
    that you also should do just as I have done to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:12–15)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Amen, amen, I tell you:
    a servant is not greater than his master,
    nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
    If you know these things,
    blessed are you if you do them”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:16–17)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Betrayer Revealed</h3>

  <p>
    “I am not speaking of all of you;
    I know whom I have chosen.
    But the Scripture will be fulfilled:
    ‘He who eats My bread has lifted his heel against Me.’
    I am telling you this now,
    before it takes place,
    so that when it does take place
    you may believe that I am He”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA041.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ps 41:9)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:18–19)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After saying these things,
    Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    one of you will betray Me.”
    The disciples looked at one another,
    uncertain of whom He spoke.
    One of His disciples — whom Jesus loved —
    was reclining at table at Jesus’ side
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:21–23)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus whom He was talking about.
    So that disciple leaned back against Jesus and said,
    “Lord, who is it?”
    Jesus answered,
    “It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread
    when I have dipped it.”
    So when He had dipped the morsel,
    He gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
    Then after he had taken the morsel,
    Satan entered into him.
    Jesus said to him,
    “What you are going to do, do quickly.”
    And Judas went out.
    And it was night
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:24–30)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>A New Commandment</h3>

  <p>
    When Judas had gone out,
    Jesus said,
    “Now is the Son of Man glorified,
    and God is glorified in Him.
    If God is glorified in Him,
    God will also glorify Him in Himself,
    and glorify Him at once.
    Little children,
    I am with you a little while longer.
    You will seek Me,
    and just as I said to the Jews,
    ‘Where I am going you cannot come,’
    so now I say to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:31–33)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “A new commandment I give to you:
    that you love one another.
    Just as I have loved you,
    you also are to love one another.
    By this everyone will know
    that you are My disciples,
    if you have love for one another”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:34–35)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Peter’s Denial Foretold</h3>

  <p>
    Simon Peter said,
    “Lord, where are You going?”
    Jesus answered,
    “Where I am going you cannot follow Me now,
    but you will follow afterward.”
    Peter said,
    “Lord, why can’t I follow You now?
    I will lay down my life for You.”
    Jesus answered,
    “Will you lay down your life for Me?
    Amen, amen, I tell you,
    the rooster will not crow
    until you have denied Me three times”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:36–38)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 13</h2>

  <h3>1. Foot-washing redefines greatness in the New Creation</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus performs the task of a slave
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:4–5)</a>.
    This is not a ritual to reenact,
    but a revelation of New Creation leadership:
    authority expressed through self-giving love,
    not hierarchy or control.
  </p>

  <h3>2. “You are clean” — covenant cleansing, not moral perfection</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus declares the disciples clean
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:10)</a>.
    This is covenant language.
    They are already transferred out of the old system
    and into relationship with Him,
    even before the cross is completed.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Judas represents the old world turning against the Son</h3>
  <p>
    Judas’ betrayal is not random.
    It fulfills Scripture
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA041.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ps 41:9)</a>
    and embodies the old covenant order
    choosing self-interest over life.
    “And it was night”
    signals more than time —
    it signals spiritual darkness closing in.
  </p>

  <h3>4. “Now is the Son of Man glorified” — not later</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus says “now”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:31)</a>.
    The cross is not delay;
    it is exaltation.
    Glory and suffering are fused in the New Creation narrative.
  </p>

  <h3>5. The new commandment replaces the old code</h3>
  <p>
    Love “as I have loved you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:34)</a>
    replaces Torah as covenant identity marker.
    This is not future ethics;
    it is present New Creation law —
    the law of Christ.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Peter’s failure does not cancel his calling</h3>
  <p>
    Peter’s denial is foretold
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN13.htm#v38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 13:38)</a>.
    The New Creation is not built on flawless followers,
    but on restored ones.
    Grace, not performance,
    carries the story forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 13 marks the shift from public confrontation
    to intimate formation.
    The old world is collapsing,
    but a new community is being shaped —
    defined by love,
    humility,
    and shared life in the Son.
