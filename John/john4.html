<h2>Paraphrase — Living Water and True Worship (John 4)</h2>

<p>Jesus left Judea and passed through Samaria. Tired from the journey, He sat beside Jacob’s well while His disciples went to buy food. A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus asked her for a drink.</p>

<p>The woman was surprised that a Jewish man would speak to her. Jesus answered that if she knew the gift of God and who was speaking to her, she would have asked Him, and He would have given her living water.</p>

<p>She questioned how He could provide water without a bucket and asked whether He was greater than Jacob. Jesus replied that whoever drinks ordinary water will thirst again, but whoever drinks the water He gives will never thirst. That water would become a spring within them, welling up to eternal life.</p>

<p>When the woman asked for this water, Jesus exposed her life — not to shame her, but to reveal that He knew her fully. She perceived Him to be a prophet and raised the long-standing dispute about the proper place of worship: Mount Gerizim or Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Jesus answered that the hour was coming — and now was — when worship would no longer be tied to this mountain or that city. True worshipers would worship the Father in spirit and truth, because God is Spirit.</p>

<p>The woman spoke of the coming Messiah. Jesus said plainly, “I am He.” Leaving her water jar behind, she returned to her town and testified that she had encountered a man who told her everything about herself.</p>

<p>Many Samaritans believed because of her testimony, and many more believed because of Jesus’ own words. They confessed that He was truly the Savior of the world.</p>

<p>Jesus then returned to Galilee, where He healed the son of a royal official. The man believed Jesus’ word, and his household came to life through that trust.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jesus, speaking openly outside Jewish religious structures</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> A Samaritan woman, her town, and later Galileans</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The dismantling of sacred geography and the expansion of covenant life beyond Jerusalem</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Jesus announced that access to God was no longer mediated by place, ethnicity, or temple — but by Spirit.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) Samaria signals covenant expansion</h3>
<p>Jesus deliberately crosses ethnic, religious, and moral boundaries. This is not a side story. It is a preview of the New Covenant world where access to God is no longer restricted to Israel’s sacred centers.</p>

<h3>2) Living water replaces covenant scarcity</h3>
<p>The well represents inherited tradition and limited access. Jesus offers life that flows from within, not provision rationed through lineage or ritual.</p>

<h3>3) What ended</h3>
<p>The rivalry between Mount Gerizim and Jerusalem, the idea that God’s presence is fixed to a sacred location, and temple-based mediation of worship.</p>

<h3>4) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Spirit-and-truth worship — life in direct union with God, independent of geography, ethnicity, or ritual status.</p>

<h3>5) “The hour is coming and now is”</h3>
<p>Jesus declares the covenant transition already underway. Worship is no longer future-oriented. The new mode of access has arrived in Him.</p>

<h3>6) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>This shift was sealed through Jesus’ death and resurrection and made unmistakable when the Jerusalem temple system was removed in AD 70. Worship was permanently detached from place.</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>You do not approach God by traveling to sacred spaces or performing correct rituals. God meets you where you are, because His life flows from within you. Worship is no longer something you attend — it is something you live.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>If worship is no longer tied to place, where are you still limiting God’s presence to certain locations or moments?</p>
