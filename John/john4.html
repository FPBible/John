<h1>John 4</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Samaritan Woman (John 4:1–26)</h2>

<p><strong>4:1–3</strong> When Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard He was making and baptizing more disciples than John—though Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples—He left Judea and went back to Galilee.</p>

<p><strong>4:4–6</strong> He had to pass through Samaria. He came to a town called Sychar, near the field Jacob had given to Joseph. Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired from the journey, sat by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>

<p><strong>4:7–9</strong> A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said, “Give Me a drink.” The woman said, “How is it that You, a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For Jews had no dealings with Samaritans.</p>

<p><strong>4:10</strong> Jesus replied, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”</p>

<p><strong>4:11–12</strong> She said, “Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do You get that living water? Are You greater than our father Jacob?”</p>

<p><strong>4:13–14</strong> Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will thirst again. But whoever drinks the water I give will never thirst. It will become a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</p>

<p><strong>4:15–18</strong> The woman said, “Sir, give me this water.” Jesus said, “Go, call your husband.” She answered, “I have no husband.” Jesus said, “You’re right. You have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband.”</p>

<p><strong>4:19–20</strong> The woman said, “Sir, I see that You are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say Jerusalem is the place to worship.”</p>

<p><strong>4:21–24</strong> Jesus said, “Believe Me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. True worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such people.”</p>

<p><strong>4:25–26</strong> The woman said, “I know Messiah is coming.” Jesus said, “I—the One speaking to you—am He.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Harvest & Witness (John 4:27–42)</h2>

<p><strong>4:27–30</strong> The disciples returned and were amazed He was speaking with a woman. She left her water jar, went into the town, and said, “Come see a man who told me everything I ever did.”</p>

<p><strong>4:31–34</strong> The disciples urged Him to eat. Jesus said, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.”</p>

<p><strong>4:35–38</strong> “Lift up your eyes—the fields are already white for harvest. Others labored, and you have entered their labor.”</p>

<p><strong>4:39–42</strong> Many Samaritans believed because of the woman’s testimony. They said, “We know this One truly is the Savior of the world.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Healing the Official’s Son (John 4:43–54)</h2>

<p><strong>4:43–45</strong> Jesus returned to Galilee. The Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all He did at the feast.</p>

<p><strong>4:46–50</strong> An official begged Jesus to heal his dying son. Jesus said, “Go; your son lives.” The man believed and went.</p>

<p><strong>4:51–54</strong> His servants met him, saying the boy was alive. This was the second sign Jesus performed in Galilee.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) Samaria is not a detour — it is prophetic</h3>
<p>Jesus crosses covenant boundaries. Samaritans were half-breed covenant outsiders. This encounter signals the collapse of ethnic and geographical barriers.</p>

<h3>2) Living water fulfills prophetic promise</h3>
<p>Living water is Ezekiel 47, Isaiah 55, Zechariah 14 imagery. Jesus claims to be the source.</p>

<h3>3) “Five husbands” = covenant instability</h3>
<p>This is not a moral shaming story. Samaria had a long history of broken covenant allegiance. Jesus exposes religious fracture, not private scandal.</p>

<h3>4) Worship is detached from geography</h3>
<p>Neither Gerizim nor Jerusalem. Worship is relocated into Spirit and truth — fulfilled presence, not sacred real estate.</p>

<h3>5) Harvest language = end-of-age gathering</h3>
<p>The fields are ready because the old covenant age is collapsing and a new people is being formed.</p>

<h3>6) “Savior of the world” expands covenant scope</h3>
<p>This is not universalism language — it is covenant inclusion beyond Israel.</p>
