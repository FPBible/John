<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read This Gospel</h2>

<p>
This work presents the Gospel of John as a unified, historically grounded testimony
that speaks from within its own first-century horizon
and announces realities that are present, active, and complete in Christ.
</p>

<p>
John does not write to speculate about distant futures.
He writes to proclaim life that has arrived,
light that has entered the world,
judgment that is already at work,
and glory revealed through the Son.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, this paraphrase avoids reading John
as if his language were primarily predictive or deferred.
Instead, the Gospel is allowed to speak in its own tense —
declaring what Christ has accomplished,
what He has inaugurated,
and what His hearers were being summoned to live within then,
and continue to live within now.
</p>

<p>
<strong>This Preface establishes the interpretive lens used throughout the Gospel
and is assumed in every chapter that follows.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Paraphrase and Commentary</h2>

<p>
The narrative sections remain close to the flow and structure of the biblical text.
Interpretive expansion within the paraphrase itself is intentionally restrained.
Where John speaks with layered or poetic language,
that texture is preserved rather than flattened.
</p>

<p>
The fulfilled perspective is made explicit in the commentary sections,
not embedded into the narrative.
This distinction allows readers to clearly see
what John is saying
and how those words are being understood within their covenant context.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment and the New Creation</h2>

<p>
Throughout the Gospel,
John repeatedly speaks of
life already given,
judgment already present,
glory already shared,
and access already opened.
</p>

<p>
In this work,
these themes are not treated as promises awaiting completion,
but as realities grounded in the work of Christ
and unfolding within the lives of His first hearers.
</p>

<p>
Fulfillment here is not the cancellation of hope,
but its realization.
The New Creation is not postponed to another age;
it is revealed through the risen Christ
and lived through union with Him.
</p>

<h2>A Word on History</h2>

<p>
The historical transition from old covenant structures
to New Covenant life
forms an essential backdrop to John’s Gospel.
</p>

<p>
This work acknowledges historical fulfillment
where it clarifies the text,
but it does not attempt to construct prophetic timelines
or speculative systems.
The focus remains on what John proclaims:
that the Word became flesh,
that light overcame darkness,
and that life is available now in the Son.
</p>

<h2>An Invitation</h2>

<p>
This Gospel is offered not as a system to master,
but as a testimony to receive.
John writes so that readers may believe,
and in believing, have life.
That purpose remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>
Read slowly.
Attend to the language.
Let the Gospel speak.
</p>

<p>
The invitation is not to wait for life,
but to recognise it.
</p>
