<h1>John 6</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Bread in the Wilderness (John 6:1–15)</h2>

<p><strong>6:1–4</strong> After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was doing on the sick. Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</p>

<p><strong>6:5–9</strong> Seeing the crowd, Jesus asked Philip, “Where are we to buy bread so that these may eat?” He said this to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do. Philip answered that even two hundred denarii would not be enough. Andrew mentioned a boy with five loaves and two fish — but what were they among so many?</p>

<p><strong>6:10–13</strong> Jesus had the people sit down. He took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them. They ate as much as they wanted, and twelve baskets were filled with what remained.</p>

<p><strong>6:14–15</strong> When the people saw the sign, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.” Perceiving that they were about to seize Him to make Him king, Jesus withdrew by Himself.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Bread from Heaven (John 6:16–59)</h2>

<p><strong>6:16–21</strong> That evening Jesus came to His disciples walking on the sea. They were afraid, but He said, “It is I; do not be afraid.” Then they willingly received Him into the boat.</p>

<p><strong>6:22–27</strong> The crowd sought Jesus, not because they understood the sign, but because they had eaten their fill. Jesus told them not to work for food that perishes, but for food that remains to eternal life.</p>

<p><strong>6:28–33</strong> They asked what works God required. Jesus answered, “This is the work of God: that you believe in Him whom He sent.” They appealed to Moses and the manna, but Jesus corrected them — it was not Moses who gave the bread from heaven, but the Father.</p>

<p><strong>6:35</strong> Jesus said, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst.”</p>

<p><strong>6:41–42</strong> The Jews grumbled because He said He came down from heaven. They knew His family and His town and could not accept that God’s provision had shifted from system to person.</p>

<p><strong>6:48–51</strong> “I am the living bread. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live. The bread I will give is My flesh, for the life of the world.”</p>

<p><strong>6:52–58</strong> This saying caused offense. Jesus pressed further, saying that unless they ate His flesh and drank His blood, they had no life in themselves. He spoke covenant participation language — not ritual cannibalism.</p>

<p><strong>6:59</strong> These things He said in the synagogue at Capernaum.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Words of Eternal Life (John 6:60–71)</h2>

<p><strong>6:60–66</strong> Many disciples said, “This word is hard; who can hear it?” Jesus knew they were offended and said, “The flesh profits nothing; the words I speak are Spirit and life.” Many turned back and no longer walked with Him.</p>

<p><strong>6:67–69</strong> Jesus asked the Twelve if they would also leave. Peter answered, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.”</p>

<p><strong>6:70–71</strong> Jesus answered that one of them was a devil — speaking of Judas, who would betray Him.</p>

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) The wilderness pattern is being closed</h3>
<p>The feeding mirrors Israel’s wilderness story. But unlike Moses, Jesus does not point beyond Himself. He declares the system finished. Manna sustained Israel temporarily; Christ sustains permanently.</p>

<h3>2) Passover frames covenant transition</h3>
<p>The timing is deliberate. Passover always pointed toward liberation through death. Jesus places Himself at the center of that meaning.</p>

<h3>3) Eating and drinking are covenant language</h3>
<p>Blood was forbidden under the Law. Jesus crosses that boundary intentionally, announcing that the Law itself is being replaced by participation in His life.</p>

<h3>4) Grumbling exposes covenant resistance</h3>
<p>The complaint echoes Israel’s wilderness rebellion. The issue is not clarity, but refusal to leave Moses.</p>

<h3>5) Resurrection language is corporate and present</h3>
<p>Being “raised on the last day” speaks of covenant transition from death in the Law to life in the Son — fulfilled in the first-century judgment and restoration.</p>
