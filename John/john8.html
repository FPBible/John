  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 8 — Light of the World and the End of Old Identity</h2>

  <h3>The Woman Caught in Adultery</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
    Early in the morning He came again into the temple,
    and all the people came to Him.
    He sat down and taught them
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:1–2)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery.
    They set her in the middle and said,
    “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.
    In the law Moses commanded us to stone such women.
    What do You say?”
    They said this to test Him,
    so they might have something to accuse Him of
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:3–6)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with His finger.
    But when they persisted in asking Him,
    He straightened up and said,
    “Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”
    Then He bent down and wrote on the ground again
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:6–8)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When they heard it, they went out one by one,
    beginning from the oldest, until Jesus was left alone with the woman.
    Jesus stood up and said,
    “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
    She said, “No one, Lord.”
    Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you.
    Go, and from now on sin no more.”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:9–11)</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Jesus: The Light of the World</h3>

  <p>
    Again Jesus spoke to them, saying,
    “I am the Light of the world.
    Whoever follows Me will not walk in the darkness,
    but will have the light of life”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:12)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Pharisees said, “You testify about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”
    Jesus answered,
    “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is true,
    because I know where I came from and where I am going.
    But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
    You judge according to the flesh;
    I judge no one.
    Yet if I do judge, My judgment is true,
    because I am not alone — the Father who sent Me is with Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:13–16)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “In your law it is written that the testimony of two people is true.
    I am one who testifies about Myself,
    and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/DEU19.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Deut 19:15)</a>;
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:17–18)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said, “Where is Your Father?”
    Jesus answered,
    “You know neither Me nor My Father.
    If you knew Me, you would know My Father also.”
    He spoke these words in the treasury, as He taught in the temple,
    and no one arrested Him, because His hour had not yet come
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:19–20)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Freedom and True Sonship</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus said again,
    “I am going away, and you will seek Me, and you will die in your sin.
    Where I go, you cannot come.”
    The Jews said, “Will He kill Himself?”
    Jesus said,
    “You are from below; I am from above.
    You are of this world; I am not of this world.
    Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins;
    for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:21–24)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said, “Who are You?”
    Jesus said,
    “Exactly what I have been telling you from the beginning.
    I have many things to speak and judge concerning you,
    but He who sent Me is true,
    and what I have heard from Him, these I speak to the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:25–26)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “When you have lifted up the Son of Man,
    then you will know that I am He,
    and that I do nothing on My own,
    but as the Father taught Me, I speak these things.
    And He who sent Me is with Me.
    He has not left Me alone,
    for I always do the things that please Him”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:28–29)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As He spoke these things, many believed in Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:30)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed Him,
    “If you remain in My word, then you are truly My disciples.
    You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:31–32)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They answered,
    “We are Abraham’s offspring and have never been enslaved to anyone.
    How can You say, ‘You will become free’?”
    Jesus answered,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you,
    everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin.
    The slave does not remain in the house forever;
    the Son remains forever.
    So if the Son sets you free,
    you will be free indeed”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:33–36)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Who Is Your Father?</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus continues:
    “I know that you are Abraham’s offspring,
    yet you seek to kill Me,
    because My word finds no place in you.
    I speak what I have seen with My Father,
    and you do what you have heard from your father.”
    They answered, “Abraham is our father.”
    Jesus said,
    “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.
    But now you seek to kill Me — a man who has told you the truth I heard from God.
    Abraham did not do this”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:37–40)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said, “We were not born of sexual immorality;
    we have one Father — God.”
    Jesus said,
    “If God were your Father, you would love Me,
    for I came from God and I am here.
    I did not come on My own, but He sent Me.
    Why do you not understand My speech?
    Because you cannot hear My word”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:41–43)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You are of your father the devil,
    and you want to do your father’s desires.
    He was a murderer from the beginning
    and does not stand in the truth.
    When he lies, he speaks from his own nature,
    for he is a liar and the father of lies.
    But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:44–45)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Which of you convicts Me of sin?
    If I tell the truth, why don’t you believe Me?
    Whoever is of God hears the words of God.
    The reason you don’t hear is that you are not of God”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:46–47)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Before Abraham Was, I AM</h3>

  <p>
    The Jews answered, “Aren’t we right in saying You are a Samaritan and have a demon?”
    Jesus answered,
    “I do not have a demon.
    I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.
    I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge.
    Amen, amen, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:48–51)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said,
    “Now we know You have a demon!
    Abraham died, and the prophets too —
    yet You say, ‘If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste death.’
    Are You greater than our father Abraham?”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:52–53)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus answered,
    “If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing.
    It is My Father who glorifies Me —
    the One you say is your God.
    Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him.
    Abraham rejoiced to see My day; he saw it and was glad.”
    They said, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”
    Jesus said to them,
    “Amen, amen, I tell you, before Abraham was, I AM.”
    So they picked up stones to throw at Him,
    but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v54" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:54–59)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 8</h2>

  <h3>1. The adultery trap exposes the system, not the woman</h3>
  <p>
    The leaders use Moses as a weapon,
    not as a pointer to truth.
    Jesus turns the trap back on the accusers
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:7)</a>.
    The story functions as a living picture of the old order:
    quick to condemn,
    slow to heal,
    obsessed with leverage.
    Jesus embodies the New Covenant verdict: mercy, truth, and restoration.
  </p>

  <h3>2. “I am the Light” means the new day has arrived</h3>
  <p>
    “I am the Light of the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:12)</a>
    is not a future promise; it’s a present claim.
    Light has entered the old world.
    Darkness is now being exposed and judged by His presence.
  </p>

  <h3>3. “Die in your sins” is covenant language</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus warns the leaders that they will “die in your sins”
    unless they believe in Him
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:24)</a>.
    In this Gospel, “sin” is not just moral failure;
    it is covenant rebellion — refusing the Son and clinging to the old age.
    To reject Him is to remain in the condemned world that is passing away.
  </p>

  <h3>4. True freedom is Sonship, not Abrahamic bragging</h3>
  <p>
    They appeal to Abraham and deny slavery
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:33)</a>.
    Jesus exposes a deeper bondage:
    slavery to sin.
    Freedom is not ethnicity or Torah identity;
    freedom is the Son releasing you into the household that lasts
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:35–36)</a>.
    That’s New Creation identity: the Son remains; the slave system collapses.
  </p>

  <h3>5. “Your father the devil” is about the murderous system</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus isn’t giving a cartoon demon lecture.
    He is exposing the spiritual fathering behind their actions:
    a system rooted in murder, accusation, and lies
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:44)</a>.
    In a fulfilled lens, “devil” functions as the accusatory power operating through that covenant order,
    aiming to kill the Son and silence the truth.
  </p>

  <h3>6. “Before Abraham was, I AM” is a divine claim — and a crisis point</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus identifies Himself with the divine “I AM”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN08.htm#v58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 8:58)</a>,
    echoing God’s self-revelation
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EXO03.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Ex 3:14)</a>.
    Their reaction (stone Him) shows they understood exactly what He meant.
    This is the intensifying conflict leading to the old world’s judgment and replacement.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 8 is the collision of ages:
    Light vs darkness,
    Sonship vs slavery,
    truth vs accusation.
    The New Creation isn’t being announced as “one day” —
    it’s confronting the old world in real time,
    and the old world is unraveling under the presence of the I AM.
  </p>
