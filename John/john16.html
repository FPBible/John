  <h1>Gospel of John — Fulfilled Paraphrase</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 16 — Sorrow Turned to Joy, Judgment Already at Work</h2>

  <h3>Persecution and Scattering</h3>

  <p>
    Jesus said,
    “I have said these things to you
    so that you will not fall away.
    They will put you out of the synagogues.
    Indeed, the hour is coming
    when whoever kills you
    will think he is offering service to God.
    They will do these things
    because they have not known the Father,
    nor Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:1–3)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “But I have told you these things,
    so that when their hour comes,
    you may remember that I told you.
    I did not say these things to you from the beginning,
    because I was with you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:4)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Advantage of His Departure</h3>

  <p>
    “Now I am going to Him who sent Me,
    and none of you asks Me,
    ‘Where are You going?’
    But because I have said these things to you,
    sorrow has filled your hearts.
    Nevertheless, I tell you the truth:
    it is to your advantage that I go away.
    For if I do not go away,
    the Helper will not come to you.
    But if I go,
    I will send Him to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:5–7)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Spirit Convicts the World</h3>

  <p>
    “When He comes,
    He will convict the world
    concerning sin,
    righteousness,
    and judgment:
    concerning sin,
    because they do not believe in Me;
    concerning righteousness,
    because I go to the Father
    and you will see Me no longer;
    concerning judgment,
    because the ruler of this world
    has been judged”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:8–11)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Spirit Guides Into Truth</h3>

  <p>
    “I still have many things to say to you,
    but you cannot bear them now.
    When the Spirit of truth comes,
    He will guide you into all the truth.
    For He will not speak on His own authority,
    but whatever He hears He will speak,
    and He will declare to you
    the things that are coming.
    He will glorify Me,
    for He will take what is Mine
    and declare it to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:12–14)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “All that the Father has is Mine;
    therefore I said that He will take what is Mine
    and declare it to you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:15)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Sorrow That Gives Birth to Joy</h3>

  <p>
    “A little while,
    and you will see Me no longer;
    and again a little while,
    and you will see Me.”
    Some of His disciples said to one another,
    “What does He mean by ‘a little while’?”
    Jesus knew they wanted to ask Him and said,
    “You will weep and lament,
    but the world will rejoice.
    You will be sorrowful,
    but your sorrow will turn into joy”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:16–20)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “When a woman is giving birth,
    she has sorrow because her hour has come.
    But when she has delivered the baby,
    she no longer remembers the anguish,
    for joy that a human being has been born into the world.
    So also you have sorrow now,
    but I will see you again,
    and your hearts will rejoice,
    and no one will take your joy from you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:21–22)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Direct Access to the Father</h3>

  <p>
    “In that day
    you will ask nothing of Me.
    Amen, amen, I tell you:
    whatever you ask the Father in My name,
    He will give it to you.
    Until now you have asked nothing in My name.
    Ask, and you will receive,
    that your joy may be full”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:23–24)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have said these things to you in figures of speech.
    The hour is coming
    when I will no longer speak to you in figures,
    but will tell you plainly about the Father.
    In that day you will ask in My name,
    and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf;
    for the Father Himself loves you,
    because you have loved Me
    and have believed that I came from God”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:25–27)</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Peace in the Midst of Trouble</h3>

  <p>
    “I came from the Father
    and have come into the world;
    again, I am leaving the world
    and going to the Father.”
    His disciples said,
    “Now You are speaking plainly
    and not using figures of speech!
    Now we know that You know all things.”
    Jesus answered,
    “Do you now believe?
    Behold, the hour is coming,
    indeed it has come,
    when you will be scattered,
    each to his own home,
    and will leave Me alone.
    Yet I am not alone,
    for the Father is with Me”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:28–32)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have said these things to you,
    so that in Me you may have peace.
    In the world you will have tribulation.
    But take courage:
    I have overcome the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:33)</a>.

  <h2>Fulfilled Commentary — John 16</h2>

  <h3>1. “Put out of the synagogues” is covenant rupture</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus predicts expulsion from synagogue life
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:2)</a>.
    This is not generic persecution,
    but the tearing apart of the old covenant community
    as allegiance shifts to the Son.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Spirit convicts the *world*, not the Church</h3>
  <p>
    Conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:8–11)</a>
    is directed toward the old world system.
    Sin is unbelief in Christ.
    Righteousness is His vindication.
    Judgment is already pronounced.
  </p>

  <h3>3. “The ruler of this world has been judged” is past, not pending</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus speaks in the perfect tense:
    judgment has occurred
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:11)</a>.
    This aligns with the cross as decisive victory,
    not a future courtroom scene.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Birth imagery signals New Creation arrival</h3>
  <p>
    Sorrow giving way to joy
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:21)</a>
    is creation language.
    A new humanity is being born
    through the death, resurrection,
    and outpouring of the Spirit.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Direct access replaces mediated religion</h3>
  <p>
    “The Father Himself loves you”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:27)</a>
    ends priestly distance.
    Access is immediate,
    relational,
    and permanent.
  </p>

  <h3>6. “I have overcome the world” declares finished victory</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus does not say,
    “I will overcome.”
    He says,
    “I have overcome the world”
    <a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JHN16.htm#v33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Jn 16:33)</a>.
    The New Creation stands on a completed triumph,
    even before the cross is enacted in history.
  </p>

  <p>
    John 16 brings everything into focus:
    judgment is active,
    the Spirit is incoming,
    sorrow is temporary,
    and victory is settled.
    The New Creation is not waiting to begin —
    it is breaking in now.
  </p>
