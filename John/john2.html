<h1>John 2</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Wedding at Cana (John 2:1–12)</h2>

<p><strong>2:1–2</strong> On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, and Jesus and His disciples were also invited.</p>

<p><strong>2:3–5</strong> When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no wine.” Jesus replied, “Woman, what does this have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come.” She told the servants, “Whatever He tells you to do—do it.”</p>

<p><strong>2:6–8</strong> Now six stone water jars were there, used for Jewish purification. Jesus said, “Fill them with water.” They filled them to the brim. Then He said, “Draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.”</p>

<p><strong>2:9–10</strong> When he tasted it, the water had become wine. He didn’t know where it came from, but the servants knew. He said, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and after people have drunk freely, the lesser wine—but You have kept the best until now!”</p>

<p><strong>2:11</strong> This, the first of His signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee. It revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.</p>

<p><strong>2:12</strong> After this He went down to Capernaum with His mother, brothers, and disciples, and stayed there a few days.</p>

<h2>Paraphrase — Cleansing the Temple (John 2:13–25)</h2>

<p><strong>2:13–16</strong> The Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem. He found people selling animals and exchanging money in the Temple courts. He made a whip, drove them out, poured out the coins, overturned tables, and said, “Stop turning My Father’s house into a marketplace!”</p>

<p><strong>2:17</strong> His disciples remembered: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.”</p>

<p><strong>2:18–19</strong> The Jews demanded, “What sign do You show for doing this?” Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</p>

<p><strong>2:20–22</strong> They said, “It took forty-six years to build this Temple!” But Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body. After His resurrection, His disciples remembered this and believed.</p>

<p><strong>2:23–25</strong> Many believed when they saw His signs, but Jesus did not entrust Himself to them. He knew what was in people.</p>

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) The Cana sign is covenant language</h3>
<p>Six stone jars = old covenant purification system.</p>
<p>Water → wine = transition.</p>
<p>The old order served its purpose. The “best” comes in Christ. This is not a party trick; it is a prophetic sign of **New Covenant joy, abundance, and fulfillment**.</p>

<h3>2) “My hour has not yet come” sets the trajectory</h3>
<p>John tracks this phrase. “Hour” always points toward His suffering, resurrection, and covenant climax—ultimately tied into judgment upon the old system in AD70.</p>

<h3>3) Temple cleansing is not random anger — it is prophetic judgment</h3>
<p>This is Malachi 3 imagery. The Lord comes to His Temple to purify it. This is not reform; this is judgment. The system is corrupt and nearing its end.</p>

<h3>4) “Destroy this temple…” — Jesus replaces the Temple</h3>
<p>John tells you plainly: Jesus is the true Temple.  
God’s presence is no longer tied to a building.  
Access, atonement, priesthood = fulfilled in Him.</p>

<h3>5) He knew what was in man</h3>
<p>This isn’t psychology commentary. It is covenant realism. Human power, religion, and flesh cannot sustain the Kingdom. Only Christ can.</p>
