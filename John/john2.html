<h1>John 2</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Water to Wine (John 2:1–12)</h2>

<p>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. Jesus and His disciples were also invited. When the wine ran out, His mother told Him. Jesus replied that His hour had not yet come, yet He acted.</p>

<p>Six stone water jars stood there for the Jewish purification rites. Jesus told the servants to fill them with water to the brim. Then He said, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” When the master tasted it, the water had become wine — and it was better than what came before.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of Jesus’ signs in Cana. He revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him. After this, He went down to Capernaum with His family and disciples for a short time.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Temple Cleansed (John 2:13–25)</h2>

<p>The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple courts He found those selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and money-changers seated there. He made a whip of cords, drove them out, poured out the coins, overturned the tables, and told those selling doves, “Do not make My Father’s house a house of trade.”</p>

<p>His disciples remembered: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.” The Jewish leaders demanded a sign to justify these actions. Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</p>

<p>They misunderstood, thinking He spoke of the building. But He was speaking of the temple of His body. After He was raised, His disciples remembered and believed the Scripture and the word Jesus spoke.</p>

<p>While He was in Jerusalem at Passover, many believed because they saw the signs. Yet Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew what was in mankind.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> John the Evangelist narrating Jesus’ first public signs</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> First-century Jews living inside purification systems, temple commerce, and Passover expectation</p>
<p><strong>Covenant moment:</strong> The old covenant world is being confronted at its center — purification and temple</p>
<p><strong>Why it mattered then:</strong> Jesus signals that the old cleansing system and the old dwelling-place of God are being replaced by a better covenant reality in Himself.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) Water jars for purification are the point</h3>
<p>The jars are not decoration. They represent the old covenant cleansing system — repeated washings that never perfected the conscience. Jesus does not merely supply wine; He transforms the containers of the old order into a sign of the new.</p>

<h3>2) What ended</h3>
<p>The old purification economy (washings, ritual status, and “clean/unclean” identity) and the temple marketplace that mediated access to God were being exposed as temporary and passing away.</p>

<h3>3) What replaced it</h3>
<p>Jesus brings the better wine — covenant joy, abundance, and internal cleansing — and He becomes the true temple where God meets His people. Union replaces ritual. Presence replaces place.</p>

<h3>4) “Destroy this temple” is a covenant time-bomb</h3>
<p>Jesus speaks of His body as the true temple. His resurrection is the sign that the center of worship has shifted from stone to Son. The old temple is now living on borrowed time.</p>

<h3>5) First-century fulfillment</h3>
<p>The replacement is inaugurated in Jesus’ death and resurrection and publicly confirmed in the judgment of Jerusalem and the destruction of the physical temple in AD 70. The old covenant house falls; the living temple remains.</p>

<h2>Key Idioms & Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“My hour has not yet come”</strong> — covenant timetable, not reluctance</li>
  <li><strong>Purification jars</strong> — repeated ritual cleansing under Moses</li>
  <li><strong>“My Father’s house”</strong> — temple as covenant center (soon replaced)</li>
  <li><strong>Temple of His body</strong> — Jesus as the true dwelling of God</li>
  <li><strong>“In three days I will raise it”</strong> — resurrection as the decisive sign</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>You are not made clean by repeated rituals, religious performance, or proximity to sacred spaces. Christ is your cleansing, and Christ is the true temple. God meets you in union, not location — and the “better wine” is not a future hope but present covenant life.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Where are you still living as if God’s presence depends on a place, a ritual, or a system — instead of Christ in you?</p>
