  <div class="label">Paraphrase — John 1:1–18</div>

  <p><strong>1</strong> In the beginning, the Word already was. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>
  <p><strong>2</strong> He was there from the beginning—face to face with God.</p>
  <p><strong>3</strong> Everything came into being through Him; apart from Him, nothing that exists came to be.</p>
  <p><strong>4</strong> In Him was life—life that became the light for people.</p>
  <p><strong>5</strong> The light shines into the darkness, and the darkness never mastered it.</p>

  <p><strong>6–8</strong> God sent a man named John. He wasn’t the Light—he was a witness pointing to the Light, so people could believe.</p>

  <p><strong>9–11</strong> The true Light was coming into the world, lighting every person. He was in the world, and the world came through Him—yet the world didn’t recognize Him. He came to His own, and His own didn’t receive Him.</p>

  <p><strong>12–13</strong> But to all who did receive Him—who trusted His name—He gave the right to become God’s children: born not from bloodlines, human plans, or fleshly effort, but born from God.</p>

  <p><strong>14</strong> And the Word became flesh and <em>tabernacled</em> among us. We saw His glory—glory as the Father’s unique Son—full of grace and truth.</p>

  <p><strong>15</strong> John kept testifying: “This is the One I meant when I said, ‘The One coming after me ranks before me—because He existed before me.’”</p>

  <p><strong>16</strong> From His fullness we all received—grace piled on grace.</p>

  <p><strong>17</strong> The Law came through Moses; grace and truth arrived through Jesus the Messiah.</p>

  <p><strong>18</strong> No one has ever seen God; the only Son—who is close to the Father—has made Him known.</p>

  <div class="label">Commentary — What John Is Doing Here</div>

  <p><strong>1) “In the beginning” is covenant language, not a science lecture.</strong><br />
    John echoes Genesis on purpose, but he’s not trying to start a cosmology debate. He’s announcing a <em>new creation</em> reality in Christ—the true beginning of a new covenant world.</p>

  <p><strong>2) “The Word” is God’s self-expression and action.</strong><br />
    In the Scriptures, God creates, judges, saves, and restores by His Word (Ps 33; Isa 55). John’s point: everything God promised and spoke has taken its living form in Jesus.</p>

  <p><strong>3) Light vs darkness = revelation vs covenant blindness.</strong><br />
    “Darkness” here is not merely “bad feelings.” It’s the old world of sin, accusation, and temple-bound access—where people were kept at a distance. The Light exposes it and ends its control.</p>

  <p><strong>4) John the Baptist is the end-of-age signpost.</strong><br />
    He stands on the boundary line: the old covenant’s final prophet, pointing to the Lamb and the incoming Kingdom reality. He is “not the Light” because the system can’t save—only Christ can.</p>

  <p><strong>5) “He came to His own” = Israel first.</strong><br />
    John is telling the covenant story: Messiah comes to the covenant people; many reject Him; yet the new family of God is formed around faith, not ancestry.</p>

  <p><strong>6) “Born of God” is not self-improvement.</strong><br />
    This is not “try harder religion.” It’s new-birth life—God’s own life given to those who trust Christ. That theme will dominate John 3 and beyond.</p>

  <p><strong>7) “The Word became flesh and tabernacled” = Temple replacement.</strong><br />
    John uses tabernacle language intentionally. The Presence is no longer locked behind curtains, priesthood, or geography. Jesus Himself is the living meeting-place of God and man—the true Temple (watch John 2).</p>

  <p><strong>8) “Grace upon grace” = covenant succession.</strong><br />
    Not “a little grace plus a little law.” John contrasts Moses and Messiah: the Law was a shadow administration; Jesus brings the reality—direct access, true cleansing, and final covenant peace.</p>

<div class="section tight">
  <div class="label">Fulfilled Lens — What Must Not Be Left Vague</div>

  <p><strong>A) John is setting up AD70 logic from verse 1.</strong><br />
    If Jesus is the true Temple/Tabernacle, then the old temple becomes obsolete. John’s Gospel will repeatedly show: replacement first, then judgment on the old system.</p>

  <p><strong>B) The “world” in John is often the covenant-order under darkness.</strong><br />
    It can include humanity broadly, but in John it frequently means the organized religious world that resisted the Light—especially where “His own” rejects Him.</p>

  <p><strong>C) This chapter demands a New Creation reading.</strong><br />
    The “beginning” John announces is not a distant future hope. It’s the inauguration of a new covenant reality already breaking in through Christ’s presence.</p>
