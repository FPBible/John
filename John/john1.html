<h1>John 1</h1>
<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase + Commentary (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase (John 1:1–18)</h2>

<p><strong>1:1–2</strong> In the beginning, the Word already was. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was there from the start—face to face with God.</p>

<p><strong>1:3</strong> Everything came into being through Him; apart from Him, nothing that exists came to be.</p>

<p><strong>1:4–5</strong> In Him was life—and that life became the light for people. The light shines into the darkness, and the darkness never overcame it.</p>

<p><strong>1:6–8</strong> God sent a man named John. He wasn’t the Light—he was a witness, pointing to the Light so people could believe.</p>

<p><strong>1:9–11</strong> The true Light was coming into the world, lighting every person. He was in the world, and the world came through Him—yet the world didn’t recognize Him. He came to His own, and His own didn’t receive Him.</p>

<p><strong>1:12–13</strong> But to all who did receive Him—who trusted His name—He gave the right to become God’s children: born not from bloodlines, human striving, or fleshly effort, but born from God.</p>

<p><strong>1:14</strong> And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. We saw His glory—glory as the Father’s unique Son—full of grace and truth.</p>

<p><strong>1:15</strong> John kept testifying: “This is the One I meant when I said, ‘The One coming after me ranks before me—because He existed before me.’”</p>

<p><strong>1:16–17</strong> From His fullness we all received—grace piled on grace. The Law came through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus the Messiah.</p>

<p><strong>1:18</strong> No one has ever seen God; the only Son—who is close to the Father—has made Him known.</p>

<h2>Commentary (Fulfilled / Covenant Context)</h2>

<h3>1) “In the beginning” is covenant reset language</h3>
<p>John echoes Genesis on purpose, but he isn’t giving you a science lesson. He’s announcing the true “beginning” of God’s renewed world in Christ—new creation life arriving, not just new information.</p>

<h3>2) “Word” means God’s self-expression, action, and presence</h3>
<p>In the Scriptures, God creates, judges, heals, and restores by His Word. John’s claim is direct: everything God promised has taken living form in Jesus—God’s speech has become a Person.</p>

<h3>3) Light vs darkness is revelation vs covenant blindness</h3>
<p>“Darkness” in John isn’t only “bad behaviour.” It’s a whole order of blindness and separation—kept in place by sin, accusation, and a temple system that restricted access. Light exposes that world and ends its authority.</p>

<h3>4) John the Baptist stands at the boundary line</h3>
<p>John is the closing voice of the old covenant age, and the witness of the incoming reality. He’s not the Light because the system can’t save—he points away from himself to the Lamb.</p>

<h3>5) “He tabernacled among us” = Temple replacement has begun</h3>
<p>This is not a cute metaphor. John is saying: the Presence is no longer located behind curtains, priesthood, and geography. Jesus Himself is the meeting-place of God and man. That’s why John’s Gospel keeps colliding with temple themes and ends with judgment on the old order.</p>

<h3>6) Grace and truth replace Law as the covenant administration</h3>
<p>John doesn’t say “Law is bad.” He says it was a real administration with a purpose—but it was not the final form. Jesus brings the substance: direct access, true cleansing, and covenant peace.</p>
