      <h1>“All These Things” — 70 AD, Resurrection, Judgment, and the Prophetic Test</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">A step-by-step response to the claim: “If Christ returned in 70 AD, where is the resurrection, judgment of the nations, end of death, and promised restoration?”</p>

        <strong>The objection:</strong><br/>
        “Jesus said when <em>all</em> these things happen. He did not say when some or most happen. If Christ ‘returned’ in 70 AD without a visible appearing, without the resurrection, and without judgment of the nations, that redefines His words after the fact.”
      </div>
      <p class="note">
        This response does not dismiss the seriousness of the claim. It challenges the assumptions being loaded into the words “coming,” “resurrection,” “judgment,” “death,” and “restoration.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1) What does “all these things” actually refer to?</h2>
      <p>
        In the Olivet Discourse (<a href="https://ebible.org/web/MAT24.htm">Matthew 24</a>,
        <a href="https://ebible.org/web/MRK13.htm">Mark 13</a>,
        <a href="https://ebible.org/web/LUK21.htm">Luke 21</a>),
        Jesus is responding to a conversation about the <strong>Temple</strong> and the crisis surrounding it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“All these things” refers to the <strong>full set of signs</strong> Jesus just listed (wars, persecution, false christs, Jerusalem surrounded, tribulation, and the Temple’s desolation).</li>
        <li>“All” does <strong>not</strong> mean “every prophecy in the Bible about all time.” It means “the complete package I am describing here.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        If someone expands “all these things” to include a modern end-of-the-planet scenario, they are importing a framework, not following the discourse.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2) What about the “coming of the Son of Man” — isn’t that a visible appearing?</h2>
      <p>
        “Coming on the clouds” is established prophetic language for <strong>judicial visitation</strong> and <strong>covenant judgment</strong>.
        In the Old Testament, God is described as “coming” against nations using cloud imagery, without implying a literal sky-body appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key question is not, “Does it match a modern literal expectation?” The question is:
        <strong>Did the covenantal judgment event Jesus predicted occur in the timeframe He stated?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The discourse is addressed to living disciples with direct “you will see” language. The audience and timeframe matter.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3) “Where is the resurrection?”</h2>
      <p>
        The objection assumes “resurrection” can only mean: “biological bodies reanimated worldwide, physical death immediately stops.”
        But Scripture uses “life/death/resurrection” in covenantal and corporate ways as well.
      </p>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card" style="margin:0;">
          <h3>What the objection assumes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Graves open globally</li>
            <li>Immortality begins physically for everyone</li>
            <li>Resurrection is only biological</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="margin:0;">
          <h3>What a fulfilled framework argues</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The “end of the age” resurrection is tied to the <strong>transition of covenant ages</strong></li>
            <li>The dead in Christ are raised into the fullness of the New Covenant reality</li>
            <li>The living are gathered into that same reality (not excluded)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        That’s why Paul can stress “order” (dead first, then living) in
        <a href="https://ebible.org/web/1TH04.htm">1 Thessalonians 4</a>—it’s about covenant inclusion and vindication, not camera footage.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        You may disagree with this reading, but it must be refuted by exegesis (audience, idiom, genre), not by insisting on modern literal expectations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>4) “Where is the judgment of the nations?”</h2>
      <p>
        In Scripture, “nations” does not automatically mean “modern nation-states.” It often functions as covenantal language for
        “Gentiles” or surrounding peoples, and judgment frequently occurs through historical events.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Olivet Discourse itself centers judgment heavily on Jerusalem’s leadership and the Temple system.</li>
        <li>70 AD was a public, catastrophic, historical judgment consistent with Jesus’ warnings.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5) “Where is the end of death?”</h2>
      <p>
        The objection assumes “death ended” must mean “no more physical funerals.”
        But in the New Testament, “death” is also a reigning covenantal power: condemnation, alienation, slavery under sin and law.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Death destroyed” can mean: the <strong>power</strong> of death (condemnation) is broken permanently in Christ.</li>
        <li>Physical death still occurs, but it no longer reigns as a covenant tyrant over God’s people.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6) “Where is the restoration promised by the prophets?”</h2>
      <p>
        The prophets describe restoration using covenant-world imagery: temple, land, Zion, cosmic signs.
        The New Testament repeatedly re-anchors those promises in Christ and the New Covenant:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temple → God’s people</li>
        <li>Inheritance/land → kingdom reality in Christ</li>
        <li>Jerusalem/Zion → New Covenant community imagery</li>
        <li>New creation → life in Christ now</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        The core question: Do you read the prophets through covenant idiom and apostolic application,
        or through modern cosmology/geopolitics imposed on the text?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>7) The prophetic test (Deut 18): does it condemn a fulfilled reading?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://ebible.org/web/DEU18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a> condemns prophets whose words fail—not readers who misunderstand prophetic idiom.
        Jesus predicted specific things with specific timing markers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temple judgment language (e.g., “your house left desolate”)</li>
        <li>Near-time urgency (“this generation” in the discourse context)</li>
        <li>Siege and desolation markers (Luke 21’s “Jerusalem surrounded by armies”)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If those covenant events occurred as described in that generation, then the prophetic credibility stands.
        A fulfilled reading is not “redefining after the fact”; it is following audience, timeframe, and prophetic idiom.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>8) When does reinterpretation become falsification?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>It becomes falsification</strong> when you change the author’s intent to rescue a failed prediction.
        <strong>It is faithful interpretation</strong> when it follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Audience relevance (“you” language; first-century setting)</li>
        <li>Time statements (“near,” “at hand,” “this generation”)</li>
        <li>Old Testament prophetic idiom (cloud-coming judgment language)</li>
        <li>Genre (apocalyptic and prophetic symbols)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The irony: the “falsification” charge often assumes futurism as the default dictionary,
        then accuses anyone who reads Scripture as Scripture reads itself.
      </p>
