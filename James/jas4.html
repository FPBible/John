<h1>James 4</h1>
<h2>Humility, Desire, and Friendship with God</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JAS04.htm" target="_blank">James 4 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
James has just contrasted wisdom from above with wisdom driven by rivalry.
Now he exposes the root cause: misdirected desire.
The problem is not external pressure—it is internal allegiance.
</p>

<p>
James is not scolding pagans. He is confronting believers who have imported
the old world’s values into New Creation life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Conflict Begins in Desire (4:1–3)</h3>
<p>
Where do fights and quarrels among you come from?
Do they not come from your desires that battle within you?
</p>

<p>
You desire and do not have—so you fight.
You covet and cannot obtain—so you quarrel.
You do not have because you do not ask.
</p>

<p>
You ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives,
so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
</p>

<p class="note">
James is not condemning desire itself.
He is exposing desire that has replaced trust in God with self-gratification.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Adultery Language: Divided Loyalty (4:4–6)</h3>
<p>
You adulterous people,
do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God?
Whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
</p>

<p>
Do you think Scripture speaks without reason when it says
that God jealously longs for the spirit He has placed within us?
</p>

<p>
But He gives greater grace.
Therefore it says,
“God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
</p>

<p class="note">
This is covenant language.
“Adultery” describes divided allegiance, not moral scandal.
James is calling out loyalty drift, not personal failure.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Return to God Without Performance (4:7–10)</h3>
<p>
Submit yourselves therefore to God.
Resist the adversary, and he will flee from you.
</p>

<p>
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.
Cleanse your hands, sinners.
Purify your hearts, you double-minded.
</p>

<p>
Be afflicted, mourn, and weep.
Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.
</p>

<p class="note">
This is not emotional self-harm.
It is a call to abandon pride, illusion, and divided identity
so true joy can be restored.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Stop Playing God Over Each Other (4:11–12)</h3>
<p>
Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters.
Whoever speaks against a brother or judges a brother
speaks against the law and judges the law.
</p>

<p>
If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
There is one Lawgiver and Judge—the One who is able to save and destroy.
Who are you to judge your neighbour?
</p>

<p class="note">
James links judgmental speech with spiritual pride.
Only God defines worth and destiny.
The New Creation community is not a courtroom.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Illusion of Control (4:13–17)</h3>
<p>
Come now, you who say,
“Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, spend a year there,
trade, and make a profit.”
</p>

<p>
You do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
</p>

<p>
Instead, you should say,
“If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”
</p>

<p>
But now you boast in your arrogance.
All such boasting is evil.
</p>

<p>
So whoever knows the good they ought to do and does not do it—
for them it is sin.
</p>

<p class="note">
This is not fatalism.
It is humility: recognising that life flows from God,
not from self-made certainty.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Desire becomes destructive when it replaces trust</h3>
<p>
James traces community conflict to inward craving.
When desire becomes entitlement, relationships turn into battlegrounds.
New Creation life redirects desire toward trust and gratitude.
</p>

<h3>2) “Friendship with the world” is covenant compromise</h3>
<p>
James is not anti-creation or anti-culture.
“World” here means the status-driven, power-grasping system
that operates without reference to God.
Trying to belong to both worlds fractures the soul.
</p>

<h3>3) God’s jealousy protects relationship, not ego</h3>
<p>
Divine jealousy is covenant faithfulness.
God resists pride because pride destroys communion.
Grace flows toward humility because humility makes room for life.
</p>

<h3>4) Submission is alignment, not humiliation</h3>
<p>
“Submit to God” is not grovelling.
It is realignment—placing trust back where it belongs.
Resistance to the adversary flows naturally from that alignment.
</p>

<h3>5) Control is the final illusion James dismantles</h3>
<p>
James ends the chapter by confronting self-directed certainty.
Planning without God is not maturity—it is arrogance.
True wisdom holds plans lightly and lives dependently.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
New Creation life looks like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>desire submitted, not suppressed</li>
  <li>humility instead of control</li>
  <li>confidence without arrogance</li>
  <li>planning with open hands</li>
</ul>

<p>
Friendship with God produces peace because it removes the need to compete.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I trying to control outcomes instead of trusting God?
What desire needs to be realigned—not crushed, but redirected—this week?
</p>
