<h1>Preface — James</h1>
<h2>Living Faith in the New Creation</h2>

<p>
James is often misread as a corrective to grace.
It is not.
</p>

<p>
James assumes the New Covenant reality is already in place and asks a harder question:
<strong>What does Spirit-formed life look like when faith is real?</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How James Is Commonly Misread</h2>

<p>
James is frequently treated as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reintroduction of Law</li>
  <li>a test of whether grace is “working”</li>
  <li>a moral checklist to prove salvation</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
All of these readings miss the point. James is not pulling believers back under Torah.
He is exposing divided hearts that try to live in two worlds at once.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Actual Situation James Addresses</h2>

<p>
James writes to New Covenant believers living under pressure:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>economic inequality inside the community</li>
  <li>social favouritism</li>
  <li>religious speech without transformed conduct</li>
  <li>conflicted desires pulling believers back into old patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>
The issue is not <em>belief vs works</em>.
The issue is <em>undivided vs divided loyalty</em>.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Faith, Not Performance</h2>

<p>
When James speaks of “faith,” he is not redefining justification.
He is distinguishing between:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Living faith</strong> — trust that naturally expresses itself through love</li>
  <li><strong>Dead faith</strong> — correct ideas with no inward transformation</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
James never argues for earning life.
He exposes faith that has never come alive.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Law of Liberty</h2>

<p>
James does not revive the Mosaic Law.
He speaks of a <strong>law of liberty</strong> — a way of life formed by the Spirit,
not enforced by commandments.
</p>

<p>
This is New Creation ethics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>not external regulation</li>
  <li>not religious performance</li>
  <li>but internal transformation expressed outwardly</li>
</ul>

<p>
James assumes what Paul teaches elsewhere:
<strong>life in the Spirit produces fruit without coercion.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Wisdom From Above</h2>

<p>
James contrasts two sources of wisdom:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>wisdom shaped by rivalry, fear, and self-preservation</li>
  <li>wisdom that comes from above — pure, peaceable, gentle, sincere</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not philosophical advice.
It is a description of Spirit-formed character in the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Judgment Language in James</h2>

<p>
James uses judgment language in the same covenant framework as Jesus and the apostles.
It is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>near to his audience</li>
  <li>focused on injustice and oppression</li>
  <li>part of the first-century covenant transition</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
James does not threaten modern readers with future condemnation.
He warns his contemporaries not to align themselves with a collapsing order.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How to Read James</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Read it as New Creation instruction, not Law revival</li>
  <li>Let identity come before behaviour</li>
  <li>Watch for heart-level allegiance, not rule-keeping</li>
  <li>Read “works” as expression, not qualification</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Why James Matters Now</h2>

<p>
James is painfully relevant because it confronts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>religious language without integrity</li>
  <li>faith reduced to slogans</li>
  <li>spirituality disconnected from everyday life</li>
</ul>

<p>
It calls believers to live as whole people —
not hearing only, not performing religion,
but embodying life shaped by the Spirit.
