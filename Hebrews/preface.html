<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read Hebrews</h2>

<p>
Hebrews is not a general devotional letter.
It is a pastoral warning written into a specific historical crisis.
Its audience is Jewish believers in Jesus who are under pressure to return
to the old covenant system — temple, sacrifices, priesthood, and Law —
because following Christ has become costly.
</p>

<p>
This matters.
If Hebrews is read without its covenant and historical setting,
it quickly becomes distorted into a book about modern fear,
personal insecurity, or future end-of-the-world speculation.
That is not how the letter functions.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Situation Hebrews Addresses</h2>

<p>
The temple is still standing.
The Levitical system is still operating.
The old covenant world has not yet visibly collapsed —
but it is in its final days.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews is written from inside that closing window.
The author repeatedly uses urgent language:
“today,” “now,” “soon,” “about to,” “once more.”
These are not vague spiritual metaphors.
They are time-markers.
</p>

<p>
To retreat back to the old system at this moment
would not be harmless tradition.
It would be turning away from the finished work of the Son
just as the old order is about to be shaken and removed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What Hebrews Is (and Is Not)</h2>

<p>
Hebrews <strong>is</strong> a declaration of finality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Son is God’s final word</li>
  <li>The sacrifice is once for all</li>
  <li>The priesthood has changed</li>
  <li>Access to God is open and direct</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hebrews <strong>is not</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a threat-based manual for anxious believers</li>
  <li>a roadmap for modern end-times speculation</li>
  <li>a warning that salvation is fragile or reversible</li>
</ul>

<p>
Its warnings are real,
but they are covenantal and historical,
not psychological or abstract.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>“Last Days” and “Heavenly” Language</h2>

<p>
When Hebrews speaks of “the last days,”
it is not describing the end of the physical universe.
It is describing the final phase of the old covenant age.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, “heavenly” does not mean “far away.”
It means “from God,” “of the new order,”
and “not sourced from the temple system.”
</p>

<p>
Hebrews contrasts two worlds:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a fading, copy-and-shadow world</li>
  <li>a present, unveiled, heavenly reality in Christ</li>
</ul>

<p>
The readers are being urged to live from what has arrived,
not retreat to what is passing away.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How This Paraphrase Approaches Hebrews</h2>

<p>
In this Fulfilled / New Creation paraphrase:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time statements are taken seriously</li>
  <li>Covenant language is read covenantally</li>
  <li>Warning passages are explained in their original frame</li>
  <li>No “already / not yet” tension is imposed on the text</li>
</ul>

<p>
The paraphrase stays close to the flow of the argument.
Interpretation is made explicit in commentary sections,
not hidden inside the narrative itself.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why Hebrews Still Matters Now</h2>

<p>
Hebrews speaks powerfully to any generation
tempted to replace Christ with systems —
religious, moral, or institutional —
that promise safety but cannot give life.
</p>

<p>
Its call is not to fear,
but to confidence.
Not to retreat,
but to draw near.
</p>

<p>
The Son has spoken.
The work is finished.
The way is open.
</p>

<p>
Read Hebrews with that horizon in view.
</p>
