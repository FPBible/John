<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 8 — The New Covenant That Now Stands</h2>

<h3>The Main Point: A Seated High Priest</h3>

<p>
Now the main point in what we are saying is this:
we have such a high priest —
one who sat down at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens,
a minister of the holy place,
and of the true tent that the Lord set up, not man
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 8:1–2)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews does not describe a priest who might someday sit.
It speaks from a settled reality:
the high priest is seated, and His ministry is active.
That seated position defines the covenant environment now.
</p>

<h3>Earthly Priesthood Was a Copy and Shadow</h3>

<p>
Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices,
so it was necessary for this one to have something to offer as well
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 8:3)</a>.
If He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all,
since there are those who offer gifts according to the law.
They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things,
just as Moses was instructed when he was about to construct the tent:
“See that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/EXO25.htm#v40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Exod 25:40)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 8:4–5)</a>.
</p>

<p>
A copy is not false — it is limited.
A shadow is not evil — it is temporary.
Hebrews treats the Mosaic system as a real, functioning model
that has now been surpassed by the thing it pointed to.
</p>

<h3>A Better Ministry Means a Better Covenant</h3>

<p>
But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry,
to the extent that He is also mediator of a better covenant,
enacted on better promises
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 8:6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is not “the same covenant improved.”
Hebrews is describing a covenant replacement.
A better mediator means a different arrangement.
</p>

<h3>Jeremiah Promised a New Covenant</h3>

<p>
If the first covenant had been faultless,
there would have been no place sought for a second.
But finding fault with them, He says:
“Look, days are coming, says the Lord,
when I will establish a new covenant
with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah —
not like the covenant I made with their fathers
on the day I took them by the hand
to lead them out of the land of Egypt,
because they did not continue in My covenant,
and I turned away from them, says the Lord”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JER31.htm#v31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Jer 31:31–32)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 8:7–9)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews treats Jeremiah’s promise as fulfilled covenant reality.
The “days are coming” are not ours to postpone.
They are the prophetic horizon Hebrews lives within —
and it speaks as though the new covenant now stands.
</p>

<h3>Internal Law: Covenant Written Into People</h3>

<p>
“For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel
after those days, says the Lord:
I will put My laws into their mind,
and I will write them on their hearts.
I will be their God,
and they will be My people.
And they shall not teach each one his fellow citizen,
and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’
because they shall all know Me,
from the least to the greatest.
For I will be merciful toward their wrongs,
and their sins I will remember no more”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JER31.htm#v33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Jer 31:33–34)</a>
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 8:10–12)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This describes covenant change at the level of identity.
The old covenant relied on external regulation.
The new covenant operates from internal transformation —
not as a future wish, but as the active mechanism of the present order.
</p>

<h3>Obsolete Means No Longer Governing</h3>

<p>
By saying “new,” He has made the first obsolete.
And what is becoming obsolete and growing old
is near to disappearing
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB08.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 8:13)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews does not treat the old covenant as eternal.
It treats it as obsolete —
a system that no longer governs,
and therefore cannot be the foundation of identity or access.
</p>

<p>
What this chapter describes is not a covenant waiting to arrive,
but a covenant already established —
with the old covenant declared obsolete
and no longer fit to define life.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Hebrews 8</h2>

<h3>1. The “main point” is present enthronement</h3>
<p>
Hebrews anchors everything in a seated high priest.
A seated priest means completed work and active authority.
</p>

<h3>2. Shadow and copy are covenant categories</h3>
<p>
The Mosaic system was real, but temporary.
Its purpose was to point beyond itself to the Son’s ministry.
</p>

<h3>3. Jeremiah is treated as present fulfilment</h3>
<p>
Hebrews quotes Jeremiah to show that “new covenant” is not a late idea.
It was promised, then established, and now governs.
</p>

<h3>4. “Know the Lord” becomes normal, not rare</h3>
<p>
The new covenant is direct relational access.
It is not dependent on temple proximity or priestly mediation.
</p>

<h3>5. Obsolete means displaced</h3>
<p>
Obsolete is not “old but still required.”
It means replaced as a governing structure.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews 8 forces the issue:
New Covenant life is not a future upgrade.
It is the present covenant environment
because the Son is seated and the old system is obsolete.
