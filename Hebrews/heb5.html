<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 5 — Priesthood That Operates Now</h2>

<h3>Priesthood Exists for the People</h3>

<p>
Every high priest taken from among the people
is appointed to act on behalf of the people in matters relating to God,
to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:1)</a>.
</p>

<p>
He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray,
since he himself is subject to weakness.
Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for his own sins
as well as for those of the people
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:2–3)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This describes the limitations of the old priesthood —
it functioned within weakness
and could never fully resolve what it addressed.
</p>

<h3>Priesthood Is Assigned, Not Seized</h3>

<p>
No one takes this honour upon himself;
he is called by God,
just as Aaron was
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:4)</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the same way,
Christ did not exalt Himself to become high priest.
Instead, He was appointed by the One who said,
“You are My Son; today I have brought You forth”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA002.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 2:7)</a>,
and again,
“You are a priest forever,
according to the order of Melchizedek”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA110.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 110:4)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This priesthood is not inherited, temporary, or replaceable.
It is established by oath and functions permanently.
</p>

<h3>The Son’s Obedience Established His Priesthood</h3>

<p>
During the days of His flesh,
Jesus offered prayers and pleas with loud cries and tears
to the One able to save Him from death,
and He was heard because of His reverent trust
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:7)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although He was a Son,
He learned obedience through what He suffered.
Having been completed,
He became the source of eternal deliverance
for all who listen to Him
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:8–9)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This does not mean the Son became something He was not.
It means His priesthood was proven,
established,
and put into effect through lived obedience.
</p>

<h3>A Priesthood That Now Defines Access</h3>

<p>
God designated Him as high priest
according to the order of Melchizedek
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:10)</a>.
This designation marks a decisive shift:
access to God is no longer mediated through lineage or law,
but through a completed priestly work.
</p>

<h3>Immaturity Is Covenant Perception, Not Intelligence</h3>

<p>
There is much more to say about this,
but it is difficult to explain
because you have become slow to understand.
By this time,
you ought to be teachers,
yet you need someone to teach you again
the basic elements of God’s word
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:11–12)</a>.
</p>

<p>
You need milk, not solid food.
Everyone who lives on milk
is inexperienced with the word of righteousness,
because he remains an infant
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:13)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Maturity Is Discernment Within the New Order</h3>

<p>
Solid food belongs to the mature —
to those who, through use,
have trained their senses
to discern good from evil
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB05.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 5:14)</a>.
</p>

<p>
This discernment is not moral superiority.
It is covenant awareness —
the ability to recognise what belongs to the old order
and what belongs to the new.
</p>

<p>
What this chapter describes is not a priesthood being prepared,
but a priesthood already functioning —
with maturity defined as the ability
to live from that established reality.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Hebrews 5</h2>

<h3>1. Old priesthood exposed by contrast</h3>
<p>
Hebrews does not rehearse the old system to preserve it,
but to show why it could never deliver final access.
</p>

<h3>2. Sonship precedes priesthood</h3>
<p>
The Son does not become priest to gain status.
He ministers because His status is already secure.
</p>

<h3>3. Obedience proves, not produces, authority</h3>
<p>
Suffering does not elevate the Son.
It demonstrates the reliability of His priesthood.
</p>

<h3>4. Melchizedek signals permanence</h3>
<p>
This priesthood is not cyclical or replaceable.
It stands outside the patterns of the old covenant.
</p>

<h3>5. Immaturity is misalignment</h3>
<p>
Remaining in “milk” means clinging to covenant forms
that no longer govern reality.
</p>

<h3>6. Maturity means living from rest</h3>
<p>
The mature discern what belongs to the completed work
and order their lives accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews 5 makes the New Creation unmistakable:
a functioning priesthood,
direct access,
and maturity defined by alignment
with what God has already established.
