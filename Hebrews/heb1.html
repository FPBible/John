<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1 — The Son, Greater Than All</h2>

<h3>God Has Spoken Fully in the Son</h3>

<p>
Long ago, God spoke to the fathers in many portions and in many ways,
through the prophets.
But in these last days,
He has spoken to us in a Son —
one whom He appointed heir of all things,
and through whom He fashioned the ages.
</p>

<p>
The Son is the radiance of God’s glory
and the exact expression of His being.
He sustains all things by the word of His power.
Having completed the cleansing of sins,
He sat down at the right hand of Majesty on high.
</p>

<h3>The Son Enthroned</h3>

<p>
He has become superior to the angels,
having inherited a name more excellent than theirs.
For to which of the angels did God ever say,
“You are My Son; today I have begotten You”?
Or again,
“I will be a Father to Him,
and He shall be a Son to Me”?
</p>

<p>
When He again brings the Firstborn into the inhabited world,
He says,
“Let all God’s messengers worship Him.”
Of the angels He says,
“He makes His messengers winds,
and His ministers a flame of fire.”
</p>

<h3>The Son’s Eternal Reign</h3>

<p>
But of the Son He says,
“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,
and the sceptre of uprightness
is the sceptre of Your kingdom.
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;
therefore God, Your God,
has anointed You
with the oil of gladness beyond Your companions.”
</p>

<p>
And again,
“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,
and the heavens are the work of Your hands.
They will perish, but You remain;
they will all grow old like a garment.
Like a robe You will roll them up,
and like a garment they will be changed.
But You are the same,
and Your years will never end.”
</p>

<h3>The Son Above All Messengers</h3>

<p>
To which of the angels has He ever said,
“Sit at My right hand
until I place Your enemies
as a footstool for Your feet”?
Are they not all ministering spirits,
sent out to serve
for the sake of those
who are about to inherit salvation?
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Hebrews 1</h2>

<h3>1. “In these last days” names a covenant moment</h3>
<p>
The author speaks from within the closing period of the old covenant world.
God’s speech is no longer fragmentary or anticipatory.
It has reached its full expression in the Son.
</p>

<h3>2. Revelation is complete, not ongoing</h3>
<p>
The contrast is not between “old times” and “modern times,”
but between partial revelation and final revelation.
The Son does not add to the message —
He is the message.
</p>

<h3>3. “He sat down” signals completion</h3>
<p>
Priests under the old covenant never sat,
because their work was never finished.
The Son sits because nothing remains to be accomplished.
</p>

<h3>4. Angels are reframed, not elevated</h3>
<p>
Hebrews does not diminish angels out of scepticism;
it relocates them.
They are servants within the new order,
not mediators of it.
</p>

<h3>5. “Heir of all things” is present reality</h3>
<p>
The Son’s inheritance is not postponed.
He reigns now,
and His authority defines the shape of the new covenant world.
</p>

<h3>6. “Heavens and earth” language is covenantal</h3>
<p>
The imagery describes the passing of an old order
and the permanence of the Son’s reign.
What is shaken fades;
what is anchored in Him remains.
</p>

<h3>7. Salvation is something being inherited</h3>
<p>
The recipients are not waiting for rescue from the planet,
but receiving life within a transformed covenant reality.
Salvation is being entered,
not deferred.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews opens by anchoring everything in this claim:
God has spoken finally,
fully,
and decisively
in the Son.
