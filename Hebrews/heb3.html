<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3 — Faithfulness in God’s House</h2>

<h3>Fix Your Attention on Jesus</h3>

<p>
Therefore, holy brothers and sisters,
partners in a heavenly calling,
fix your attention on Jesus —
the apostle and high priest of our confession
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:1)</a>.
</p>

<p>
He was faithful to the One who appointed Him,
just as Moses also was faithful in God’s household
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:2)</a>.
But Jesus has been counted worthy of greater honour than Moses,
just as the builder of a house has more honour than the house itself.
</p>

<h3>The Builder and the House</h3>

<p>
Every house is built by someone,
but the One who built everything is God
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:4)</a>.
Moses was faithful as a servant within God’s house,
testifying to what would later be spoken.
But Christ is faithful as a Son over God’s house —
and we are that house,
if we hold firmly to our confidence
and the hope we openly profess
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:5–6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The contrast is not obedience versus rebellion,
but servant versus Son.
Moses belongs within the old covenant structure;
the Son stands over a renewed one.
</p>

<h3>Do Not Harden Your Hearts</h3>

<p>
Therefore, just as the Spirit says:
“Today, if you hear His voice,
do not harden your hearts
as in the rebellion,
during the day of testing in the wilderness”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA095.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 95:7–8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The wilderness generation tested God,
even after seeing His works for forty years.
As a result, He declared,
“They always go astray in their hearts,
and they have not known My ways”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA095.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 95:9–10)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Warning to a Covenant Community</h3>

<p>
Take care, brothers and sisters,
that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart
that turns away from the living God.
Instead, encourage one another daily,
while it is still called “Today,”
so that none of you is hardened
by the deceitfulness of sin
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:12–13)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sin here is not moral failure in the abstract,
but covenantal unbelief —
the refusal to trust God’s present action
in favour of familiar systems that no longer give life.
</p>

<h3>Participation Depends on Trust</h3>

<p>
We have come to share in Christ
if we hold firmly to the confidence we had at the beginning
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:14)</a>.
As it is said again:
“Today, if you hear His voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA095.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 95:7)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Who were the ones who heard and rebelled?
Were they not all those who came out of Egypt under Moses?
And with whom was God displeased for forty years?
Was it not those who sinned,
whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:16–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>Unbelief Prevents Entry</h3>

<p>
To whom did God swear that they would not enter His rest,
if not to those who disobeyed?
So we see that they were unable to enter
because of unbelief
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:18–19)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The issue was never lack of information.
It was lack of trust.
The same warning now applies to a generation
standing at the threshold of covenant change.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Hebrews 3</h2>

<h3>1. Moses is honoured, not displaced</h3>
<p>
Hebrews does not attack Moses.
It places him correctly —
as a faithful servant within a temporary structure
that pointed beyond itself.
</p>

<h3>2. “House” means covenant community</h3>
<p>
The house of God is not a building
and not a future organisation.
It is a living people defined by trust in the Son.
</p>

<h3>3. Psalm 95 becomes present warning</h3>
<p>
The wilderness story is not rehearsed as history only,
but as an active warning
to a people tempted to turn back
from the new covenant reality.
</p>

<h3>4. Unbelief is covenantal regression</h3>
<p>
The danger is not atheism,
but retreat —
returning to systems that God has already outgrown.
</p>

<h3>5. “Today” names the moment of decision</h3>
<p>
Hebrews insists that covenant transition
is not abstract or postponed.
The moment of response is now.
</p>

<h3>6. Rest is introduced, not defined yet</h3>
<p>
Chapter 3 prepares the way for the fuller discussion of rest.
It identifies unbelief as the barrier,
not time or geography.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews 3 presses the issue clearly:
faithfulness now means recognising
where God’s house truly stands —
and remaining aligned with the Son who governs it.
