<h1>Hebrews</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3 — Faithfulness Within the Present House of God</h2>

<h3>Fix Your Attention on the One Who Governs Now</h3>

<p>
Therefore, holy brothers and sisters,
participants in a heavenly calling that now defines your life,
fix your attention on Jesus —
the apostle and high priest of our confession
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:1)</a>.
</p>

<p>
He was faithful to the One who appointed Him,
just as Moses was faithful within God’s household
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:2)</a>.
But Jesus carries greater honour than Moses,
in the same way that the builder of a house carries greater honour than the house itself.
</p>

<h3>The Builder Determines the House</h3>

<p>
Every house is built by someone,
but the One who builds all things is God
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:4)</a>.
Moses was faithful as a servant within God’s house,
bearing witness to what was spoken afterward.
But Christ is faithful as a Son over God’s house —
and that house is not future.
It is the present covenant community formed by trust in Him
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:5–6)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The contrast is not between obedience and rebellion,
but between servant and Son.
Moses belongs to a covenant structure that pointed forward;
the Son governs the structure that now stands.
</p>

<h3>“Today” Names the Present Moment</h3>

<p>
Because this is so,
the Spirit speaks directly into the present reality:
“Today, if you hear His voice,
do not harden your hearts
as in the rebellion,
during the day of testing in the wilderness”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA095.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 95:7–8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The wilderness generation tested God,
even after witnessing His works.
Their failure was not lack of evidence,
but refusal to trust God’s direction
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA095.htm#v9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 95:9–10)</a>.
</p>

<h3>A Living Warning to a Living Community</h3>

<p>
Take care, brothers and sisters,
that none of you develops an unbelieving heart
that turns away from the living God.
Instead, encourage one another daily —
because “Today” is not a date on a calendar,
but the standing moment of covenant decision
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:12–13)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here, unbelief does not mean intellectual doubt.
It means covenant regression —
choosing familiarity over faith,
and systems that once served over the life that now governs.
</p>

<h3>Participation Is Lived, Not Deferred</h3>

<p>
We share in Christ
if we hold firmly to the confidence
that defined us from the beginning
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:14)</a>.
This is not about earning belonging,
but remaining aligned with the reality already given.
</p>

<p>
The Spirit repeats the warning:
“Today, if you hear His voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PSA095.htm#v7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Psalm 95:7)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Unbelief Blocks Entry Into What Already Exists</h3>

<p>
Those who came out of Egypt heard God’s voice
yet refused to trust it.
As a result, they did not enter the rest set before them
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:16–17)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion is plain:
they were unable to enter,
not because the rest was distant,
but because unbelief prevented participation
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/HEB03.htm#v18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Heb 3:18–19)</a>.
</p>

<p>
What this chapter describes is not a future warning
about a rest still pending,
but a present reality already established,
into which trust either enters or withdraws.
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Hebrews 3</h2>

<h3>1. Moses is correctly located</h3>
<p>
Hebrews honours Moses without confusing him with the Son.
He belongs within a structure that served its purpose
and has now given way to something greater.
</p>

<h3>2. “House” means covenant environment</h3>
<p>
The house of God is the lived covenant reality
governed by the Son.
It is not under construction.
It is occupied.
</p>

<h3>3. “Today” abolishes postponement</h3>
<p>
The Spirit refuses futurism.
Response is always now,
because the covenant reality is already in place.
</p>

<h3>4. Unbelief is misalignment, not ignorance</h3>
<p>
The danger is not misunderstanding doctrine,
but resisting the direction of God’s present action.
</p>

<h3>5. Rest is treated as available, not distant</h3>
<p>
Hebrews prepares the reader to understand rest
as something that exists now,
not something waiting at the end of history.
</p>

<p>
Hebrews 3 makes the issue unavoidable:
faithfulness means recognising
where God’s house now stands
and remaining aligned with the Son
who governs it.
