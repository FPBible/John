<h1>Hebrews 7</h1>
<h2>A Different Priesthood · Law Set Aside · Permanent Access</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Melchizedek and Abraham (Hebrews 7:1–10)</h2>

<p><strong>7:1–3</strong> This Melchizedek — king of Salem and priest of God Most High — met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him. Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. His name means “king of righteousness,” and also “king of peace.” Without recorded father, mother, genealogy, beginning of days, or end of life, he resembles the Son of God and remains a priest continually.</p>

<p><strong>7:4–7</strong> See how great this man was: even Abraham gave him a tenth of the spoils. Those who are sons of Levi receive tithes according to the Law — yet here, one outside that system receives tithes from Abraham and blesses him. And without dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.</p>

<p><strong>7:8–10</strong> In the one case, mortal men receive tithes; in the other, one is spoken of as living. Levi himself, through Abraham, paid tithes to Melchizedek.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — A Change of Priesthood Requires a Change of Law (Hebrews 7:11–19)</h2>

<p><strong>7:11–12</strong> If perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood, what further need would there be for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek? For when the priesthood changes, a change of law necessarily follows.</p>

<p><strong>7:13–14</strong> The One spoken of belongs to another tribe — Judah — from which no one has ever served at the altar.</p>

<p><strong>7:15–17</strong> This becomes even clearer when another priest arises, not on the basis of legal requirement, but by the power of an indestructible life. “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”</p>

<p><strong>7:18–19</strong> On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because it was weak and ineffective. On the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — A Better Covenant with a Permanent Priest (Hebrews 7:20–28)</h2>

<p><strong>7:20–22</strong> This was confirmed with an oath. The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind: “You are a priest forever.” Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</p>

<p><strong>7:23–25</strong> The former priests were many in number, because death prevented them from continuing. But He holds His priesthood permanently, because He continues forever. Therefore He is able to save completely those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.</p>

<p><strong>7:26–28</strong> Such a high priest truly fits our need — holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. He does not need to offer sacrifices daily, first for His own sins and then for the people’s. He did this once for all when He offered Himself.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Hebrews 7 makes explicit what has been implicit since chapter 1:
Christian faith is incompatible with returning to the Levitical system.
The issue is no longer preference — it is structural incompatibility.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Priesthood, Law, and Finality)</h2>

<h3>1) Melchizedek predates and outranks Levi</h3>
<p>
The argument is chronological and covenantal.
Levi is not ultimate because Levi is not first.
The older priesthood exposes the temporary nature of the Law.
</p>

<h3>2) Change of priesthood means change of Law</h3>
<p>
This is decisive.
You cannot keep the Law intact while changing the priest.
Hebrews does not reform Torah — it declares it obsolete.
</p>

<h3>3) “Set aside” means rendered inoperative</h3>
<p>
The former commandment is not adjusted or spiritualised.
It is set aside because it cannot complete access.
Its weakness is not moral failure, but structural limitation.
</p>

<h3>4) Indestructible life replaces genealogical authority</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ priesthood does not depend on ancestry or mortality.
It rests on resurrection life that cannot be interrupted or replaced.
</p>

<h3>5) Permanent priesthood secures permanent access</h3>
<p>
The problem with the old system was not sincerity —
it was death.
Priests kept dying.
In Christ, mediation no longer resets.
</p>

<h3>6) “Save completely” means nothing left unfinished</h3>
<p>
This is covenant finality.
There is no remaining sacrifice, no additional mediator,
no future access upgrade required.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Hebrews 7 removes all grounds for spiritual insecurity.
Access to God does not fluctuate.
Mediation does not expire.
Nothing needs to be repeated.
</p>

<p>
You are not maintained by ritual.
You are sustained by a living priest
who does not step aside or hand over His role.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still act as if access to God depends on something
other than the finished priesthood of Christ?
