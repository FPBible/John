<h1>Hebrews 10</h1>
<h2>The Sacrifice Finished · Confidence to Draw Near · The Approaching Day</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Law Could Never Finish the Work (Hebrews 10:1–4)</h2>

<p><strong>10:1</strong> The Law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves. Because of this, it can never perfect those who draw near through repeated sacrifices.</p>

<p><strong>10:2–4</strong> If it could, the offerings would have stopped — because worshipers, once cleansed, would no longer have a consciousness of sins. Instead, those sacrifices were a yearly reminder that sin had not been removed.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Christ Came to Do God’s Will (Hebrews 10:5–10)</h2>

<p><strong>10:5–7</strong> Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You prepared for Me. I have come to do Your will.”</p>

<p><strong>10:8–10</strong> He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — One Priest, One Offering, Forever (Hebrews 10:11–18)</h2>

<p><strong>10:11–12</strong> Every priest stands daily offering the same sacrifices that can never remove sins. But this One, after offering a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right hand of God.</p>

<p><strong>10:13–14</strong> From that time onward, He waits until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet. By one offering He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</p>

<p><strong>10:15–18</strong> The Holy Spirit testifies: “I will remember their sins no more.” Where forgiveness is complete, there is no longer any offering for sin.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Draw Near with Confidence (Hebrews 10:19–25)</h2>

<p><strong>10:19–21</strong> Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus — by a new and living way opened through the veil — and since we have a great priest over God’s house,</p>

<p><strong>10:22–25</strong> let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, hold fast the confession of hope, and encourage one another — all the more as you see the Day approaching.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — A Severe Warning Against Rejection (Hebrews 10:26–31)</h2>

<p><strong>10:26–27</strong> If we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins — only a fearful expectation of judgment and a fire that will consume the adversaries.</p>

<p><strong>10:28–29</strong> Anyone who rejected Moses’ Law died without mercy. How much more severe will the consequence be for one who tramples the Son of God and treats the blood of the covenant as unclean?</p>

<p><strong>10:30–31</strong> “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay.” It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Remember, Endure, Do Not Shrink Back (Hebrews 10:32–39)</h2>

<p><strong>10:32–34</strong> Remember the earlier days after you were enlightened — when you endured suffering, imprisonment, and loss with joy, knowing you possessed something better and lasting.</p>

<p><strong>10:35–37</strong> Do not throw away your confidence. “In a very little while, the One who is coming will come and will not delay.”</p>

<p><strong>10:38–39</strong> “My righteous one will live by faith.” We are not those who shrink back to destruction, but those who believe to the preserving of life.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>

<p>
Hebrews 10 brings the argument to its sharpest edge.
The sacrifice is finished, access is open, and the old system is about to collapse.
The only remaining danger is deliberate retreat.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (Finality and Nearness)</h2>

<h3>1) Shadows cannot perfect</h3>
<p>
The Law was never meant to complete the work.
Its repetition exposed its limits.
Completion requires finality — which only Christ provides.
</p>

<h3>2) “Abolishes the first” is covenant replacement</h3>
<p>
This is not reform language.
The old covenant is removed so the new can stand in its place.
</p>

<h3>3) Sitting down signals completion</h3>
<p>
No Levitical priest ever sat down.
Christ’s seated posture declares the work finished.
</p>

<h3>4) “The Day” is approaching in their lifetime</h3>
<p>
This is not a vague future.
It is the approaching day of covenant judgment and transition
that would publicly end the temple system.
</p>

<h3>5) Deliberate sin is covenant rejection</h3>
<p>
The warning is not about moral struggle.
It is about rejecting the only effective sacrifice
by returning to the obsolete system.
</p>

<h3>6) Fire is covenant judgment imagery</h3>
<p>
The fire language echoes the prophets.
It speaks of consuming judgment on the adversarial system —
not post-mortem torment.
</p>

<h3>7) Faith is forward trust, not backward retreat</h3>
<p>
Living by faith here means trusting Christ through transition,
not preserving the familiar at all costs.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Hebrews 10 leaves no room for religious insecurity.
The work is finished.
Access is open.
Confidence is justified.
</p>

<p>
You are invited to draw near — not cautiously,
but boldly — because nothing remains to be added.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still live as if access depends on repetition or performance,
instead of trusting the once-for-all work already completed?
</p>
