<h1>Colossians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 4 — New Creation Life Lived Outward</h2>

<p>
Masters, treat your servants with justice and fairness,
knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:1)</a>
</p>

<h3>Prayer and Watchful Living</h3>

<p>
Devote yourselves to prayer, staying alert in it with thanksgiving.
At the same time, pray for us too,
that God may open a door for the message,
so we can speak the mystery of Christ —
the very reason I am in chains.
Pray that I may make it clear, as I should.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:2–4)</a>
</p>

<p>
Live wisely toward those outside,
making the most of the opportunity.
Let your speech always be gracious,
seasoned with insight,
so you know how to answer each person.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:5–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>Partners in the Gospel</h3>

<p>
Tychicus will tell you all the news about me.
He is a beloved brother, a faithful servant, and a fellow worker in the Lord.
I’m sending him so you know how we are
and so he can encourage your hearts.
I’m also sending Onesimus —
a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you.
They will tell you everything that is happening here.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:7–9)</a>
</p>

<p>
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends greetings,
along with Mark, the cousin of Barnabas
(you have received instructions about him — welcome him if he comes to you),
and Jesus who is called Justus.
These are the only ones from the circumcision group who have worked with me
for the kingdom of God,
and they have been a comfort to me.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:10–11)</a>
</p>

<p>
Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus,
greets you.
He is always wrestling in prayer for you,
so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything God wills.
I can testify that he works hard for you
and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:12–13)</a>
</p>

<p>
Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas send greetings.
Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea,
and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:14–15)</a>
</p>

<p>
After this letter has been read among you,
make sure it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans,
and that you read the letter from Laodicea.
Tell Archippus,
“See that you complete the ministry you received in the Lord.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:16–17)</a>
</p>

<p>
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
Remember my chains.
Grace be with you.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:18)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Colossians 4</h2>

<h3>1) New Creation authority corrects power, it doesn’t reinforce it</h3>
<p>
Paul does something radical without fanfare.
He addresses masters and places them under authority.
“Justice and fairness” is not a soft suggestion —
it is a New Creation redefinition of power.
No one in Christ occupies a position that escapes accountability.
The Lordship of Christ relativises all earthly hierarchies.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:1)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Prayer is participation, not passivity</h3>
<p>
Paul does not treat prayer as retreat from the world.
It is alert, thankful, and missional.
Prayer is how the New Creation stays aligned with God’s movement in the world.
Asking for “open doors” assumes the gospel is already active,
and clarity is needed for speech, not courage for delay.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:2–4)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Wisdom toward outsiders replaces boundary maintenance</h3>
<p>
Under the old world, identity was protected by separation.
Under the New Creation, identity is secure enough to engage.
Paul doesn’t tell them to withdraw or dominate,
but to live wisely and speak graciously.
Truth is not weaponised.
Speech is seasoned, responsive, and relational.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:5–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) The gospel advances through people, not platforms</h3>
<p>
Colossians closes with names, relationships, and trust.
This is intentional.
The New Creation is not abstract theology;
it is embodied in real people carrying encouragement, news, and support.
Faithful messengers matter because the message travels through lives.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:7–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) The New Creation dismantles insider/outsider categories</h3>
<p>
Paul names Jews and Gentiles, prisoners and physicians, men and women,
house churches and travelling workers — all without hierarchy.
What matters is not category but participation in the Kingdom.
This is lived proof of what Colossians 1 declared:
Christ is all, and in all.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:10–15)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) Letters are meant to circulate because truth is communal</h3>
<p>
Paul expects the letter to be shared, read, and re-read.
The New Creation does not hoard revelation.
Truth belongs to the body.
This also reminds us that Scripture emerged in community,
not as private spiritual insight.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:16)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) Ministry is received, not invented</h3>
<p>
Archippus is told to complete what he received in the Lord.
Calling precedes performance.
Ministry is not self-appointed significance;
it is faithful participation in what God has already given.
This keeps the New Creation grounded and prevents spiritual ego.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:17)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) Chains do not contradict grace</h3>
<p>
Paul’s final words are not triumphalism.
They are realism soaked in grace.
Suffering does not invalidate the New Creation;
it simply reveals that the Kingdom advances in a contested world.
Grace remains the final word.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL04.htm">(Col 4:18)</a>
</p>

<p>
Colossians ends the way it began —
with Christ at the centre and real people living from that centre.
The New Creation is not an escape from life.
It is life re-ordered around the Lordship of Christ.
