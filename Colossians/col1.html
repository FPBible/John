<p>
Paul, appointed by God’s will, writes with Timothy to the holy and faithful
people in Colossae—those living in Christ.
Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
We continually thank God when we pray for you, because we hear of your
faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the saints.
This love flows from the hope already stored for you in the heavenly realm—
a hope you first heard about in the true message of the gospel.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:3–5)</a>
</p>

<p>
That same gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the world,
just as it has among you since the day you understood the grace of God
as it truly is.
You learned it from Epaphras, a faithful servant of Christ,
who also told us of your love produced by the Spirit.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:6–8)</a>
</p>

<h2>Prayer for Clarity and Strength</h2>

<p>
We have not stopped praying that you would be filled with the knowledge
of God’s will, with all wisdom and understanding that come from the Spirit,
so that your lives may reflect the Lord—bearing fruit, growing, and
enduring with joy.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:9–11)</a>
</p>

<p>
You give thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the
inheritance of the saints in the light.
He has rescued us from the authority of darkness and transferred us
into the kingdom of the Son He loves,
in whom we have redemption—the release from sins.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:12–14)</a>
</p>

<h2>The Supremacy of the Son</h2>

<p>
The Son is the visible expression of the invisible God,
the firstborn over all creation—not a created being,
but the one who holds rank and authority over it.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:15)</a>
</p>

<p>
All things were created in Him, through Him, and for Him—
things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
including thrones, dominions, rulers, and authorities.
He existed before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:16–17)</a>
</p>

<p>
He is the head of the body—the covenant community.
He is the beginning, the first to rise out from death,
so that He holds first place in everything.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:18)</a>
</p>

<p>
All fullness was pleased to dwell in Him,
and through Him God reconciled all things to Himself,
making peace through the blood of His cross—
things on earth and things in heaven.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:19–20)</a>
</p>

<h2>Reconciled and Made Whole</h2>

<p>
You were once alienated and hostile in your thinking,
entangled in destructive ways.
But now He has reconciled you through Christ’s physical death,
to present you holy, blameless, and beyond accusation.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:21–22)</a>
</p>

<p>
Remain grounded and settled in the hope of the gospel,
not shifting back into old systems of identity.
This gospel has been openly proclaimed,
and I, Paul, have become its servant.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:23)</a>
</p>

<h2>The Mystery Revealed</h2>

<p>
The mystery hidden through ages and generations
has now been revealed to God’s people:
Christ in you—the hope of glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:24–27)</a>
</p>

<p>
We proclaim Him, instructing and warning everyone with wisdom,
so that every person may stand complete in Christ.
For this purpose I labour,
striving according to His power already at work in me.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL01.htm">(Col 1:28–29)</a>
