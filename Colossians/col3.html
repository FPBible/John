<h1>Colossians</h1>

<h2>Chapter 3 — New Identity First, New Life Follows</h2>

<p>
If you have been raised with Christ, set your focus on the realities above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
Set your mind on the things above, not on the things of the earth.
For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ, who is your life, is revealed, you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:1–4)</a>
</p>

<h3>Put Off the Old Practices</h3>

<p>
So put to death what belongs to the old way: sexual immorality, impurity, uncontrolled passion, corrupt desire, and greed—which is idolatry.
These are the kinds of things that brought judgment on the old world.
You once walked in these ways when that old life defined you.
But now put it all away: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy speech.
Do not lie to one another, since you have stripped off the old person with its practices.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:5–9)</a>
</p>

<p>
You have put on the new person, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its Creator.
In this new humanity, there is no Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free—
Christ is all, and in all.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:10–11)</a>
</p>

<h3>Put On the New Practices</h3>

<p>
So, as God’s chosen people—holy and beloved—put on compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
Bear with one another, and forgive one another.
If anyone has a complaint against another, forgive as the Lord forgave you.
Above all, put on love, which binds everything together in perfect unity.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:12–14)</a>
</p>

<p>
Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since you were called into one body.
Be thankful.
Let the word of Christ live richly among you—teaching and warning one another with wisdom—
with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with gratitude in your hearts to God.
And whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:15–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>New Covenant Households</h3>

<p>
Wives, align with your husbands in a way that fits the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and do not become harsh with them.
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
Fathers, do not crush your children, so they don’t lose heart.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:18–21)</a>
</p>

<p>
Servants, obey your earthly masters in everything—not only when watched, not as people-pleasers—
but with sincerity of heart, revering the Lord.
Whatever you do, work from the heart, as for the Lord and not for people,
knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward.
You are serving the Lord Christ.
For the wrongdoer will be repaid for the wrong, and there is no partiality.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:22–25)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Colossians 3</h2>

<h3>1) “Raised with Christ” is not motivation — it’s location</h3>
<p>
Paul doesn’t begin with behaviour. He begins with union.
Raised with Christ means the believer’s life-source and identity have been relocated.
This is the same New Creation logic as Colossians 1–2:
if your life is in Christ, then the old system no longer defines you.
“Set your mind” is not positive thinking; it’s living from the correct realm.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:1–4)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) “You died” means the old identity system lost its claim</h3>
<p>
Paul’s “death” language is covenantal and participatory.
You died to the old order—the realm that measured life by externals, accusations, and flesh-driven identity.
So when Paul says “put to death,” he’s not contradicting himself.
He’s saying: make your practices match your relocation.
Don’t live as if the old authority still owns you.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:3,5)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) The vices list is not “religion rules” — it’s the anatomy of old-world living</h3>
<p>
Sexual immorality, impurity, greed, rage, slander, lying — Paul isn’t inventing a new law-code.
He’s naming what the old world produces when identity is built on desire, fear, and self-protection.
New Creation ethics are not arbitrary.
They are what happens when a person is no longer driven by lack.
The target is not “looking holy,” but walking in what matches union.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:5–9)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) “The new person” is not a self-improvement project</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say, “Create a new you.”
He says you have put on the new person.
Renewal is the ongoing alignment of mind and practice with what is already true in Christ.
That keeps this from becoming performance spirituality.
The New Creation is given; renewal is the lived outworking.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) “Christ is all, and in all” is the death of tribal spirituality</h3>
<p>
Paul explicitly kills identity markers: Greek/Jew, circumcision/uncircumcision, slave/free.
This is not vague unity talk.
It’s covenant reality: the old dividing walls are gone because the substance is Christ.
Any spirituality that rebuilds “insider/outsider” identity structures is anti-Colossians.
If Christ is all and in all, then status games are finished.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:11)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) The “put on” list is New Creation character, not religious branding</h3>
<p>
Compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience — these are not badges to prove spirituality.
They are what love looks like when the ego is no longer fighting for survival.
Forgiveness is central because the old world runs on debt-keeping.
The New Creation runs on release, because God has already released us.
Love binds it together because love is the nature of this new life.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:12–14)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) “Let the peace of Christ rule” means peace becomes the internal governor</h3>
<p>
Peace here is not mood management.
It is the ruling authority inside the person and the community.
Colossians 2 said the accusing record was cancelled and the powers disarmed.
Colossians 3 now says: let peace take the throne, not fear, not control, not rivalry.
This is what it looks like when reconciliation is believed.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:15)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) “Word of Christ” living richly is communal formation, not information addiction</h3>
<p>
Paul’s picture is a community shaped by Christ’s word—teaching, warning, singing, gratitude.
Not a community shaped by rules.
Songs and psalms are not performance; they are a way the New Creation rehearses truth until it becomes instinct.
Gratitude is a weapon against lack, because it trains the heart to live from fullness.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:16–17)</a>
</p>

<h3>9) Household instructions are about New Covenant conduct inside real life</h3>
<p>
Paul is not building a utopia; he’s transforming the everyday.
“Fits the Lord” is the key phrase.
Whatever your social setting is, New Creation life shows up as love, gentleness, and integrity.
He explicitly forbids harshness and crushing leadership in the home.
That’s New Creation authority: strength expressed as care, not domination.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:18–21)</a>
</p>

<h3>10) Work is re-framed: not people-pleasing, but serving Christ</h3>
<p>
This does not romanticise slavery; it injects New Creation reality into a broken world.
Paul shifts the centre: you are serving the Lord Christ.
He also levels the ground by insisting God shows no partiality.
In other words: earthly status does not determine heavenly worth.
Inheritance language here reinforces what Colossians 1 said:
inheritance is not wages; it is the family gift of those in the Son.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/COL03.htm">(Col 3:22–25)</a>
</p>

<p>
Colossians 3 is identity-driven holiness.
Not law. Not shadow. Not ladders.
Union first, then practice.
Raised with Christ, therefore live like it.
