<h1>Isaiah</h1>

<h2>Chapters 52–53 — The Servant’s Suffering and Vindication</h2>

<h3>Good News Announced</h3>

<p>
How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of the one who brings good news,
who proclaims peace,
who brings good news of happiness,
who proclaims salvation,
who says to Zion,
“Your God reigns!”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA52.htm">(Isa 52:7)</a>
</p>

<p>
Break forth together into singing,
you waste places of Jerusalem,
for the LORD has comforted His people;
He has redeemed Jerusalem.
The LORD has bared His holy arm
before the eyes of all the nations,
and all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of our God.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA52.htm">(Isa 52:9–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Servant Introduced</h3>

<p>
Behold, My servant shall act wisely;
He shall be high and lifted up,
and shall be exalted.
As many were astonished at You —
His appearance was marred beyond human semblance,
and His form beyond that of the children of humanity —
so shall He startle many nations;
kings shall shut their mouths because of Him,
for that which has not been told them they see,
and that which they have not heard they understand.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA52.htm">(Isa 52:13–15)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Rejected Servant</h3>

<p>
Who has believed what we have heard?
And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
For He grew up before Him like a young plant,
and like a root out of dry ground;
He had no form or majesty that we should look at Him,
and no beauty that we should desire Him.
He was despised and rejected by men,
a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
and as one from whom men hide their faces
He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:1–3)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Meaning of the Suffering</h3>

<p>
Surely He has borne our sicknesses
and carried our pains;
yet we esteemed Him stricken,
smitten by God, and afflicted.
But He was pierced for our transgressions;
He was crushed for our iniquities;
upon Him was the discipline that brought us peace,
and by His wounds we are healed.
All we like sheep have gone astray;
we have turned — every one — to his own way;
and the LORD has laid on Him
the iniquity of us all.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:4–6)</a>
</p>

<p>
He was oppressed, and He was afflicted,
yet He opened not His mouth;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
so He opened not His mouth.
By oppression and judgment He was taken away;
and as for His generation,
who considered that He was cut off
out of the land of the living,
stricken for the transgression of My people?
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:7–8)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Vindication of the Servant</h3>

<p>
They made His grave with the wicked
and with a rich man in His death,
although He had done no violence,
and there was no deceit in His mouth.
Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush Him;
He has put Him to grief;
when His soul makes an offering for guilt,
He shall see His offspring;
He shall prolong His days;
the will of the LORD shall prosper in His hand.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:9–10)</a>
</p>

<p>
Out of the anguish of His soul He shall see and be satisfied;
by His knowledge shall the righteous One, My servant,
make many to be accounted righteous,
and He shall bear their iniquities.
Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the many,
and He shall divide the spoil with the strong,
because He poured out His soul to death
and was numbered with the transgressors;
yet He bore the sin of many
and makes intercession for the transgressors.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:11–12)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Isaiah 52–53</h2>

<h3>1) The gospel is the announcement of reign, not an invitation to escape</h3>
<p>
Isaiah defines “good news” as the declaration that God reigns.
This frames the gospel as a public announcement,
not a private transaction.
New Covenant faith responds to a finished reality,
not a conditional offer.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA52.htm">(Isa 52:7)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Exaltation comes through suffering, not instead of it</h3>
<p>
The Servant is “high and lifted up” —
language later applied to the LORD Himself —
yet His path to exaltation runs through disfigurement and rejection.
This collapses triumphalist expectations
and redefines glory through self-giving love.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA52.htm">(Isa 52:13–15)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) The rejection of the Servant exposes human blindness</h3>
<p>
The Servant’s lack of outward majesty reveals how deeply humans misjudge value.
Power, appearance, and dominance fail as indicators of divine activity.
The New Creation is unveiled through humility, not spectacle.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:1–3)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) Substitution is covenantal, not transactional</h3>
<p>
The Servant bears sickness, grief, transgression, and iniquity.
This is not a cosmic bookkeeping exercise.
It is covenant repair:
the consequences of alienation absorbed
so peace and healing can be restored.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:4–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Silence before violence unmasks false power</h3>
<p>
The Servant does not defend Himself.
His silence exposes the injustice of the system that condemns Him.
The New Creation advances not by overpowering enemies,
but by absorbing and exposing violence.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:7)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) Death is not the end of the Servant’s story</h3>
<p>
Isaiah insists the Servant will “see offspring” and “prolong days.”
Suffering leads to multiplication, not extinction.
This anticipates resurrection logic —
life emerging where death seemed final.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:10)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) Righteousness is shared, not achieved</h3>
<p>
The Servant “makes many righteous.”
Righteousness here is not moral perfection,
but restored standing and belonging.
This becomes the New Testament doctrine
of righteousness as gift, not performance.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:11)</a>
</p>

<h3>8) Intercession continues beyond the cross</h3>
<p>
The Servant not only bears sin —
He continues to intercede.
This establishes ongoing reconciliation,
not a one-time legal fiction.
The New Creation lives from sustained union with the Servant.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA53.htm">(Isa 53:12)</a>
</p>

<p>
Isaiah 52–53 is the heart of the New Covenant:
God reigns,
the Servant suffers,
sin is absorbed,
peace is restored,
and a new humanity emerges.
Everything else in Scripture leans on this axis.
