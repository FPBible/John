<h1>Isaiah</h1>

<h2>Chapter 49 — The Servant and the Restoration of All</h2>

<h3>The Servant Called and Formed</h3>

<p>
Listen to Me, O coastlands,
and pay attention, you peoples from far away.
The LORD called Me from the womb,
from the body of My mother He named My name.
He made My mouth like a sharp sword;
in the shadow of His hand He hid Me.
He made Me a polished arrow;
in His quiver He concealed Me.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:1–2)</a>
</p>

<p>
He said to Me, “You are My servant, Israel,
in whom I will be glorified.”
But I said, “I have laboured in vain,
I have spent My strength for nothing and vanity;
yet surely My justice is with the LORD,
and My reward with My God.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:3–4)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Servant’s Expanded Mission</h3>

<p>
And now the LORD says —
He who formed Me from the womb to be His servant,
to bring Jacob back to Him,
and that Israel might be gathered to Him —
for I am honoured in the eyes of the LORD,
and My God has become My strength —
He says:
“It is too small a thing that You should be My servant
to raise up the tribes of Jacob
and restore the preserved of Israel;
I will also make You a light for the nations,
that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:5–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>Rejected Yet Vindicated</h3>

<p>
Thus says the LORD,
the Redeemer of Israel and His Holy One,
to One deeply despised, abhorred by the nation,
the servant of rulers:
“Kings will see and arise;
princes will bow down,
because of the LORD, who is faithful,
the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:7)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Covenant of Release</h3>

<p>
Thus says the LORD:
“In a time of favour I have answered You;
in a day of salvation I have helped You.
I will keep You and give You
as a covenant for the people,
to restore the land
and to reassign desolate inheritances,
to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’
to those in darkness, ‘Show yourselves.’
They shall feed along the ways;
on all bare heights shall be their pasture.
They shall not hunger or thirst,
neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them,
for He who has compassion on them will lead them,
and by springs of water will guide them.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:8–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>The Gathering of a Worldwide People</h3>

<p>
Behold, these shall come from far away,
and behold, these from the north and from the west,
and these from the land of Syene.
Sing for joy, O heavens,
and exult, O earth;
break forth, O mountains, into singing!
For the LORD has comforted His people
and will have compassion on His afflicted.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:12–13)</a>
</p>

<h3>Zion Reassured</h3>

<p>
But Zion said,
“The LORD has forsaken me;
my Lord has forgotten me.”
Can a woman forget her nursing child,
that she should have no compassion
on the son of her womb?
Even these may forget,
yet I will not forget you.
Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands;
your walls are continually before Me.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:14–16)</a>
</p>

<p>
Lift up your eyes all around and see;
they all gather, they come to you.
As I live, declares the LORD,
you shall put them all on as an ornament;
you shall bind them on as a bride does.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:18)</a>
</p>

<h3>The End of Captivity</h3>

<p>
Can the prey be taken from the mighty,
or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?
For thus says the LORD:
“Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken,
and the prey of the tyrant be rescued,
for I will contend with those who contend with you,
and I will save your children.
Then all flesh shall know
that I am the LORD your Saviour,
and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:24–26)</a>
</p>

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary — Isaiah 49</h2>

<h3>1) The Servant embodies faithful Israel</h3>
<p>
The Servant is called “Israel,” yet distinct from the nation.
This is not confusion — it is condensation.
The calling of Israel is gathered into one faithful representative.
In New Covenant terms, Christ fulfils Israel’s vocation
and then shares it with His body.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:3–6)</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Apparent failure does not negate divine purpose</h3>
<p>
The Servant speaks of labouring “in vain.”
Isaiah acknowledges rejection without redefining calling.
Fulfillment often looks like loss before it looks like victory.
The New Creation is born through apparent defeat.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:4)</a>
</p>

<h3>3) Gentile inclusion is not Plan B</h3>
<p>
“It is too small a thing” exposes ethnic limitation.
From the start, God’s intention was universal restoration.
The New Covenant does not widen late —
it reveals what was always intended.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:6)</a>
</p>

<h3>4) The covenant is now embodied in a person</h3>
<p>
The Servant is given “as a covenant.”
This is the seed of New Covenant theology:
relationship mediated through a person, not a system.
In Christ, covenant life becomes relational and participatory.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:8)</a>
</p>

<h3>5) Release language announces comprehensive restoration</h3>
<p>
Prisoners, darkness, hunger, thirst —
these are covenant conditions, not merely physical states.
Isaiah announces a holistic liberation that anticipates
forgiveness, reconciliation, and renewed belonging.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:9–10)</a>
</p>

<h3>6) God’s remembrance overrides Zion’s fear</h3>
<p>
Zion’s lament is answered with maternal imagery.
God’s commitment is deeper than human memory.
The New Creation rests on divine faithfulness,
not human perception.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:14–16)</a>
</p>

<h3>7) Restoration ends captivity and exposes false power</h3>
<p>
The final word belongs to deliverance, not oppression.
God identifies Himself as Saviour and Redeemer.
In New Covenant reality, captivity is broken
and God’s identity is revealed through rescue.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA49.htm">(Isa 49:24–26)</a>
</p>

<p>
Isaiah 49 expands the Servant vision:
from Israel restored,
to nations included,
to captivity ended.
The New Creation is not partial repair —
it is comprehensive reconciliation.
