<h1>Isaiah — Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read Isaiah Without Missing the Point</h2>

<p>
Isaiah is not written as a modern textbook.
It is covenant prophecy: warnings, promises, poetry, courtroom language,
and symbols drawn from Israel’s Scriptures and worship world.
</p>

<p>
Because of that, Isaiah is easy to misread.
People often import modern assumptions — about the universe, geopolitics, or “end-times charts” —
and miss what Isaiah is actually doing: exposing false worship, judging corrupt leadership,
and announcing restoration through God’s own action.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) Isaiah Uses “Creation” Language Covenantally</h2>

<p>
Isaiah uses images like “heavens and earth,” cosmic shaking, darkened lights,
and world-collapsing language.
In the prophets, this often describes the fall of a ruling order
and the replacement of a covenant world — not the destruction of the physical universe.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) Isaiah Targets Real People in Real Situations</h2>

<p>
Isaiah is anchored in history: Judah, Jerusalem, kings, alliances, idolatry,
oppression, exile, and return.
Even when Isaiah stretches forward, he speaks into covenant realities —
faithfulness, judgment, mercy, and restoration.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) The Servant Theme Matters</h2>

<p>
Isaiah’s servant passages are not decorative.
They carry the centre of Isaiah’s hope:
God restores, heals, gathers, and renews through His servant.
The New Testament repeatedly identifies Jesus within this theme.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Zion and Jerusalem Are Theological Symbols Too</h2>

<p>
Isaiah speaks of Zion as more than geography.
It is a symbol of covenant centre, worship, and identity.
When Isaiah promises renewed Zion, it is renewed covenant life —
not merely city planning.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) Read Isaiah With the New Testament in View</h2>

<p>
The New Testament writers treat Isaiah as already “in motion” toward fulfilment:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the good news of deliverance</li>
  <li>the ingathering of the nations</li>
  <li>the servant’s suffering and vindication</li>
  <li>new creation language describing covenant renewal in Christ</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not a denial of Isaiah’s historical setting.
It is the claim that Isaiah’s vision reaches its fulfilment in the Messiah
and the New Covenant world.
