<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Israel’s Story as Living Instruction (10:1–5)</h3>

<p>
I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,
that our ancestors were all under the cloud
and all passed through the sea.
</p>

<p>
They were all immersed into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
and all ate the same spiritual food
and drank the same spiritual drink.
</p>

<p>
They drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them —
and that rock was Christ.
</p>

<p>
Yet God was not pleased with most of them,
and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Warnings Already Given for Our Instruction (10:6–11)</h3>

<p>
These things became examples for us,
so that we would not crave evil things as they did.
</p>

<p>
Do not become idolaters, as some of them were —
as it is written,
“The people sat down to eat and drink,
and rose up to play.”
</p>

<p>
We are not to commit sexual immorality,
as some of them did —
and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.
</p>

<p>
We are not to test the Lord,
as some of them did —
and were destroyed by serpents.
</p>

<p>
And do not grumble,
as some of them did —
and were destroyed by the destroyer.
</p>

<p>
These things happened to them as examples,
and they were written down for our instruction —
for us, upon whom the end of the ages has already come.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>God’s Faithfulness in Temptation (10:12–13)</h3>

<p>
So let the one who thinks they stand
be careful that they do not fall.
</p>

<p>
No temptation has overtaken you
except what is common to humanity.
God is faithful —
He will not allow you to be tested beyond what you can bear,
but with the testing He also provides the way out,
so that you are able to endure it.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Flee Idolatry and Share in Christ (10:14–22)</h3>

<p>
Therefore, my beloved,
flee from idolatry.
</p>

<p>
I speak as to sensible people —
judge for yourselves what I am saying.
</p>

<p>
The cup of blessing that we bless —
is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ?
The bread that we break —
is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?
</p>

<p>
Because there is one bread,
we who are many are one body,
for we all share in the one bread.
</p>

<p>
Consider Israel according to the flesh:
are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
</p>

<p>
What am I saying then?
That food sacrificed to idols is anything?
Or that an idol is anything?
No.
</p>

<p>
But I say that what the nations sacrifice,
they sacrifice to demonic powers and not to God.
I do not want you to be participants with demonic powers.
</p>

<p>
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord
and the cup of demons.
You cannot share the Lord’s table
and the table of demons.
</p>

<p>
Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy?
Are we stronger than He?
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Freedom Governed by Love (10:23–33)</h3>

<p>
“All things are lawful,” you say —
but not all things are beneficial.
“All things are lawful” —
but not all things build up.
</p>

<p>
No one is to seek their own good,
but the good of the other.
</p>

<p>
Eat whatever is sold in the market without raising questions of conscience,
for “the earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”
</p>

<p>
If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you wish to go,
eat whatever is set before you without raising questions of conscience.
</p>

<p>
But if someone says to you,
“This has been offered in sacrifice,”
do not eat it —
for the sake of the one who informed you,
and for conscience.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean your own conscience,
but the other person’s.
For why should my freedom be judged by another’s conscience?
</p>

<p>
If I partake with gratitude,
why am I criticised for what I give thanks for?
</p>

<p>
So whether you eat or drink,
or whatever you do,
do everything for God’s glory.
</p>

<p>
Do not give offence to Jews or Greeks
or the church of God —
just as I try to please everyone in everything I do,
not seeking my own advantage,
but that of many,
so that they may be brought into life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Chapter 10 completes Paul’s discussion of freedom and idolatry (chs. 8–10).
Israel’s wilderness story is not ancient trivia —
it is a mirror.
Paul warns a spiritually confident church
not to repeat covenant failure
while assuming immunity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “The end of the ages has already come” is explicit fulfillment language</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say the end <em>will</em> come.
He says it <em>has</em> come upon them (10:11).
This refers to the covenant transition
from the Mosaic age into life in Christ.
The paraphrase renders this as present and completed
because Paul uses it as present motivation.
</p>

<h3>2) Israel’s failures warn New Covenant believers</h3>
<p>
Paul reads Israel typologically,
not futuristically.
Their story instructs those living in the fulfilled age
about temptation, presumption, and faithfulness.
</p>

<h3>3) Participation language replaces ritual thinking</h3>
<p>
Sharing in the bread and cup is real participation in Christ,
not symbolic theatre.
This is why idolatry is incompatible —
it attempts divided participation.
</p>

<h3>4) Freedom is subordinate to love and glory</h3>
<p>
Paul does not restrict freedom with new laws.
He governs it with love, conscience, and God’s glory.
New Creation life expresses itself
through voluntary restraint for the sake of others.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Baptised into Moses” (10:2):</strong> covenant identification, not Christian baptism.</li>
  <li><strong>“Rock was Christ” (10:4):</strong> Christ as the true sustaining presence behind Israel’s story.</li>
  <li><strong>“End of the ages” (10:11):</strong> completion of covenant history, not the end of the planet.</li>
  <li><strong>“Demons” (10:20):</strong> spiritual powers operating through idol systems, not cartoon beings.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Living in a fulfilled age does not remove responsibility —
it deepens it.
Confidence without humility repeats Israel’s mistake.
True freedom remembers the story,
shares one table,
and chooses love over entitlement.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where might confidence be blinding me to vulnerability —
and how can I let love govern my freedom today?
</p>

<h1>1 Corinthians 10</h1>
<h2>Warning from Israel · Faithful Participation</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul reminds the Corinthians that Israel shared in real covenant privileges:
baptism into Moses, spiritual food, and spiritual drink.
Yet many fell because desire displaced trust.
Participation does not guarantee faithfulness.
</p>

<p>
These events serve as warnings,
not because history repeats mechanically,
but because covenant lessons endure.
The old story exposes what happens
when freedom drifts into presumption.
</p>

<p>
Paul reassures them that temptation is not unique or unstoppable.
God’s faithfulness provides a way through,
not necessarily a way around.
Endurance is possible.
</p>

<p>
He then draws a sharp boundary around allegiance.
Participation at the Lord’s table
is participation in Christ.
To share tables indiscriminately
is to blur covenant loyalty.
</p>

<p>
Paul concludes by returning to freedom.
All things may be lawful,
but not all things build.
The guiding question is not “May I?”
but “Does this serve love and glory?”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Paul addresses overconfidence.
Some Corinthians assume knowledge protects them.
Paul shows that covenant privilege without discernment
leads to compromise.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Israel’s story is covenant instruction</h3>
<p>
Paul reads Israel typologically.
The point is not threat,
but formation.
Old Covenant failure teaches New Covenant wisdom.
</p>

<h3>2) “Spiritual food and drink” points to participation</h3>
<p>
Paul treats the wilderness story sacramentally.
Shared experience does not equal shared faithfulness.
Presence invites responsibility.
</p>

<h3>3) Table fellowship defines allegiance</h3>
<p>
Meals are not neutral.
They express belonging.
The Lord’s table announces union;
other tables announce competing loyalties.
</p>

<h3>4) Freedom is evaluated by love</h3>
<p>
Paul does not retract freedom.
He reorients it.
Love and edification become the measuring line.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Exodus 16–17 — wilderness provision</li>
  <li>Psalm 106 — covenant failure</li>
  <li>Romans 14 — freedom and conscience</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Union with Christ is not casual.
It is life-shaping.
Freedom thrives when allegiance is clear
and love directs participation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might familiarity be dulling discernment
instead of deepening faithfulness?
</p>
