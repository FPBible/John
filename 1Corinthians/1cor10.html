<h1>1 Corinthians 10</h1>
<h2>Warning from Israel · Faithful Participation</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul reminds the Corinthians that Israel shared in real covenant privileges:
baptism into Moses, spiritual food, and spiritual drink.
Yet many fell because desire displaced trust.
Participation does not guarantee faithfulness.
</p>

<p>
These events serve as warnings,
not because history repeats mechanically,
but because covenant lessons endure.
The old story exposes what happens
when freedom drifts into presumption.
</p>

<p>
Paul reassures them that temptation is not unique or unstoppable.
God’s faithfulness provides a way through,
not necessarily a way around.
Endurance is possible.
</p>

<p>
He then draws a sharp boundary around allegiance.
Participation at the Lord’s table
is participation in Christ.
To share tables indiscriminately
is to blur covenant loyalty.
</p>

<p>
Paul concludes by returning to freedom.
All things may be lawful,
but not all things build.
The guiding question is not “May I?”
but “Does this serve love and glory?”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Paul addresses overconfidence.
Some Corinthians assume knowledge protects them.
Paul shows that covenant privilege without discernment
leads to compromise.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Israel’s story is covenant instruction</h3>
<p>
Paul reads Israel typologically.
The point is not threat,
but formation.
Old Covenant failure teaches New Covenant wisdom.
</p>

<h3>2) “Spiritual food and drink” points to participation</h3>
<p>
Paul treats the wilderness story sacramentally.
Shared experience does not equal shared faithfulness.
Presence invites responsibility.
</p>

<h3>3) Table fellowship defines allegiance</h3>
<p>
Meals are not neutral.
They express belonging.
The Lord’s table announces union;
other tables announce competing loyalties.
</p>

<h3>4) Freedom is evaluated by love</h3>
<p>
Paul does not retract freedom.
He reorients it.
Love and edification become the measuring line.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Exodus 16–17 — wilderness provision</li>
  <li>Psalm 106 — covenant failure</li>
  <li>Romans 14 — freedom and conscience</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Union with Christ is not casual.
It is life-shaping.
Freedom thrives when allegiance is clear
and love directs participation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might familiarity be dulling discernment
instead of deepening faithfulness?
</p>
