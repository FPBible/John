<h1>1 Corinthians 6</h1>
<h2>Union, Not Lawsuits · Bodies as God’s Dwelling</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul rebukes believers for taking disputes before civil courts.
Doing so denies their shared identity and future calling.
If they are to participate in God’s ordering of the world,
they should be able to resolve matters within the community.
</p>

<p>
He reminds them that their former identities do not define them.
They were washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of Jesus
and by the Spirit of God.
Their past does not own their future.
</p>

<p>
Paul then addresses sexual immorality.
Freedom is not the absence of boundaries;
it is the presence of purpose.
The body is not disposable.
It belongs to the Lord and is destined for resurrection life.
</p>

<p>
Union language dominates the warning.
To unite the body with destructive behaviour
is to deny who the body belongs to.
Believers are not autonomous;
they are joined to Christ.
</p>

<p>
Paul ends with the decisive claim:
their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit.
They were bought with a price.
Therefore, they glorify God not by rule-keeping,
but by living from who they already are.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
The Corinthian believers are importing secular values
into covenant life—litigation, sexual license, and autonomy.
Paul counters by grounding ethics in union,
not external control.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Lawsuits deny New Covenant identity</h3>
<p>
Appealing to outside courts declares the community incapable
of living from shared life in Christ.
Paul’s concern is not legal process,
but covenant contradiction.
</p>

<h3>2) “Will not inherit the kingdom” is identity language</h3>
<p>
This phrase does not threaten believers with loss of salvation.
It names behaviours that do not belong
to the New Creation inheritance.
Paul immediately affirms their transformation.
</p>

<h3>3) The body matters because the covenant changed</h3>
<p>
Greek culture separated spirit and body.
Paul refuses that split.
If God now dwells in people,
the body becomes sacred space.
</p>

<h3>4) Freedom is redefined by belonging</h3>
<p>
“You are not your own” is not oppression.
It is liberation from self-ownership.
Belonging to Christ frees the body
from being used or discarded.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>John 17 — shared life and unity</li>
  <li>Romans 8 — life in the Spirit</li>
  <li>Ephesians 2 — God dwelling in people</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Your body is not an afterthought.
It is where God chooses to dwell.
Ethics flow from union, not anxiety.
Freedom is lived, not defended.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be acting as though my life belongs to me,
rather than living from union with Christ?
</p>
