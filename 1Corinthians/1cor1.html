<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Called into a New Reality (1:1–9)</h3>

<p>
Paul, called as an apostle of Jesus Christ by God’s will, and Sosthenes our brother,
write to the community in Corinth — people already set apart in Christ Jesus,
already called into holiness, together with everyone everywhere who calls on the name
of Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.
</p>

<p>
Grace and peace have been given to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
I give thanks continually because God’s grace has already been poured out among you in Christ.
You have already been enriched in speech and knowledge,
just as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you.
Because of this, you are not lacking any gift
as you live within the revealed presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
He is also sustaining you to the end,
so that you stand blameless in the day when Jesus Christ is openly recognised as Lord.
God is faithful — and you have already been brought into fellowship with His Son.
</p>

<h3>Division Exposed (1:10–17)</h3>

<p>
I appeal to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:
stop fragmenting yourselves.
Be united in the same mind and purpose.
</p>

<p>
It has been reported to me that quarrels exist among you.
One says, “I belong to Paul.”
Another, “I belong to Apollos.”
Another, “I belong to Cephas.”
Another, “I belong to Christ.”
</p>

<p>
Has Christ been divided?
Was Paul crucified for you?
Were you baptised into Paul’s name?
</p>

<p>
I thank God that I baptised only Crispus and Gaius —
so no one can claim you were baptised into my identity.
Yes, I also baptised the household of Stephanas;
beyond that, I don’t recall baptising anyone else.
</p>

<p>
Christ did not send me to build a following through ritual,
but to announce the gospel —
not dressed up in clever rhetoric,
so the power of the cross would not be emptied of its effect.
</p>

<h3>The Cross Has Already Rewritten Wisdom (1:18–25)</h3>

<p>
The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
but to us who are being brought into life,
it is God’s power already at work.
</p>

<p>
Scripture has already declared:
“I am destroying the wisdom of the wise,
and I am exposing the emptiness of intelligent systems.”
</p>

<p>
Where is the philosopher?
Where is the legal expert?
Where is the debater of this age?
God has already shown the wisdom of the world to be bankrupt.
</p>

<p>
Since the world did not come to know God through its wisdom,
God was pleased to save those who trust Him
through what the world labels foolish.
</p>

<p>
Jews demanded signs.
Greeks pursued philosophical elegance.
But we proclaim Christ crucified —
a stumbling block to one group,
and nonsense to the other —
yet to those who are called,
Christ is already revealed as the power and wisdom of God.
</p>

<p>
What appears foolish in God has proven wiser than human wisdom.
What appears weak in God has proven stronger than human strength.
</p>

<h3>Boasting Has Already Been Removed (1:26–31)</h3>

<p>
Look at your own calling:
not many of you were socially impressive,
politically powerful,
or culturally elite.
</p>

<p>
But God has already chosen what the world dismisses
to shame its so-called wisdom.
God has chosen what looks weak
to expose what claims strength.
</p>

<p>
God chose what was insignificant,
ignored,
and treated as nothing,
to bring to nothing what the world thought mattered —
so that no one can boast before Him.
</p>

<p>
Because of Him, you are in Christ Jesus,
who has become for us wisdom from God —
righteousness,
sanctification,
and redemption —
so that, as Scripture says,
“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Corinth is fractured by status, personality loyalty, and cultural pride.
Paul does not treat this as a minor disagreement.
He treats it as a denial of what the cross has already accomplished:
the death of status-based identity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Revelation of the Lord” is present, not postponed</h3>
<p>
Paul speaks of believers living within the revealed presence of Christ (1:7),
not waiting for a distant unveiling.
The paraphrase renders this as present because Paul assumes Christ’s reign
and presence are already operative in the community.
</p>

<h3>2) “Those who are being saved” is covenant transition language</h3>
<p>
Paul contrasts “those perishing” with “those being brought into life” (1:18).
This is not a timeless category of humanity,
but covenant movement away from the old order and into life in Christ.
</p>

<h3>3) The cross already judged the world’s wisdom</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say God <em>will</em> destroy worldly wisdom.
He says it <em>has been</em> exposed.
The cross has already inverted value systems,
and Corinth’s divisions show they are trying to resurrect what died.
</p>

<h3>4) Boasting is already illegitimate</h3>
<p>
Because identity is now sourced “in Christ,”
all boasting based on teachers, ethnicity, intellect, or status is obsolete.
Paul does not warn that boasting <em>will</em> end —
he insists that it already has.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“This age” (1:20):</strong> covenant age, not the physical universe.</li>
  <li><strong>“Perishing / being saved” (1:18):</strong> transition language, not metaphysical destiny.</li>
  <li><strong>“Power of God” (1:18):</strong> the cross actively dismantling old identity structures.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
The New Creation does not produce superior Christians.
It produces humbled people who no longer need superiority.
Where boasting survives, the cross has not yet been allowed to speak.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I still drawing identity from something the cross has already dismantled?
</p>
