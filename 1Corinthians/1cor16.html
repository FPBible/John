<h1>1 Corinthians 16</h1>
<h2>Love That Organises Life · Final Instructions and Blessing</h2>

<p>
<strong>Fulfilled theme:</strong> New Creation life is not vague spirituality. It becomes organised generosity, trustworthy partnership,
clear moral boundaries, and love that strengthens the community.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Collection (1 Cor 16:1–4)</h2>

<p><strong>16:1</strong> Now about the collection for the saints: do what I directed the churches of Galatia to do.</p>

<p><strong>16:2</strong> On the first day of every week, each of you should set something aside and store it up, as you are prospering,
so that no collections have to be made when I arrive.</p>

<p><strong>16:3</strong> When I come, I will send with letters the people you approve, so they can carry your gift to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><strong>16:4</strong> If it seems appropriate that I also go, they will go with me.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Paul’s Plans and an Open Door (1 Cor 16:5–9)</h2>

<p><strong>16:5–6</strong> I plan to come to you after I pass through Macedonia.
I may stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so you can help me on my journey wherever I go next.</p>

<p><strong>16:7</strong> I don’t want this to be a quick visit.
I hope to remain with you if the Lord permits.</p>

<p><strong>16:8</strong> For now, I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,</p>

<p><strong>16:9</strong> because a wide door for effective work has opened to me — and there are many opponents.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Timothy, Apollos, and Workers (1 Cor 16:10–12)</h2>

<p><strong>16:10–11</strong> If Timothy comes, make sure he has nothing to fear among you.
He is doing the Lord’s work, just as I am.
So don’t despise him. Send him on his way in peace so he can come to me,
because I am expecting him with the brothers.</p>

<p><strong>16:12</strong> Concerning our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers.
But it was not at all his will to come now; he will come when he has opportunity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Final Charges (1 Cor 16:13–14)</h2>

<p><strong>16:13</strong> Be watchful. Stand firm in the faith. Act like mature men. Be strong.</p>

<p><strong>16:14</strong> Let everything you do be done in love.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — The Household of Stephanas (1 Cor 16:15–18)</h2>

<p><strong>16:15</strong> Now I urge you, brothers: you know the household of Stephanas —
they were the firstfruits of Achaia, and they devoted themselves to service to the saints.</p>

<p><strong>16:16</strong> Be subject to people like these, and to everyone who works with them and labours.</p>

<p><strong>16:17</strong> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus,
because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</p>

<p><strong>16:18</strong> They refreshed my spirit, and yours as well.
Recognise people like this.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Paraphrase — Greetings, Holiness Boundary, and Blessing (1 Cor 16:19–24)</h2>

<p><strong>16:19</strong> The churches of Asia greet you.
Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the church that meets in their house.</p>

<p><strong>16:20</strong> All the brothers greet you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>

<p><strong>16:21</strong> I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.</p>

<p><strong>16:22</strong> If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed.
Maranatha.</p>

<p><strong>16:23</strong> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</p>

<p><strong>16:24</strong> My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
After confronting division, immorality, lawsuits, marriage tensions, idolatry, Lord’s Table abuse,
gift competition, and resurrection denial, Paul ends with practical community life:
<strong>money handled wisely, workers honoured, holiness protected, love insisted on, grace spoken.</strong>
This is how New Creation maturity looks on the ground.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Commentary — Fulfilled / New Creation Lens</h2>

<h3>1) Generosity is structured, not emotional</h3>
<p>
Paul doesn’t rely on last-minute pressure. He sets a weekly rhythm (16:2).
That protects integrity, removes manipulation, and makes care dependable.
This is covenant family life expressed in money — not slogans.
</p>

<h3>2) “Open door” includes resistance</h3>
<p>
Paul expects opposition alongside opportunity (16:9).
New Covenant mission is not measured by comfort.
Fruitfulness often comes with pushback.
</p>

<h3>3) Honour the quiet workers</h3>
<p>
Stephanas and his household are highlighted because they devoted themselves to serving the saints (16:15).
Paul tells Corinth to recognise and cooperate with people like that (16:16–18).
That kills celebrity culture and builds real community.
</p>

<h3>4) Love is the governing command</h3>
<p>
Paul’s “be strong” is immediately framed by “let everything be done in love” (16:13–14).
Strength without love becomes control.
Order without love becomes cold.
Paul refuses both.
</p>

<h3>5) The hard line: “If anyone does not love the Lord…”</h3>
<p>
This isn’t a threat aimed at weak believers. It’s a boundary against those who reject the Lord
while trying to remain inside and shape the community on other terms (16:22).
Paul ends warmly — but he will not redefine the centre.
</p>

<h2>Key Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“First day of the week” (16:2):</strong> a practical rhythm for giving; not a command to build a new legalism.</li>
  <li><strong>“Be subject” (16:16):</strong> recognise and cooperate with faithful servants; honour is tied to service.</li>
  <li><strong>“Maranatha” (16:22):</strong> an Aramaic cry meaning “Our Lord, come” / “Our Lord has come,” used as a Christ-centred declaration at the close.</li>
  <li><strong>“Holy kiss” (16:20):</strong> a culturally normal sign of family unity and peace; the point is sincere reconciliation.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Prophecy Fulfilment</h2>
<p>
This chapter is not a prophecy chapter. It does not require Prophecy Hub linkage.
The “Maranatha” cry is a Christ-centred declaration, not a chart.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
New Creation life becomes visible in the boring places: regular giving, honouring workers, handling conflict cleanly,
keeping Christ central, and letting love govern strength. This is Spirit maturity: reliable, grounded, and real.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where does my faith still stay abstract — when Paul expects it to become structured love, practical honour, and steady grace?
