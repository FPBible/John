<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Gifts Without Love Are Empty (13:1–3)</h3>

<p>
If I speak in the languages of humans and angels,
but do not have love,
I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
</p>

<p>
If I have prophetic insight,
understand all mysteries and all knowledge,
and if I have all faith so as to move mountains,
but do not have love,
I am nothing.
</p>

<p>
If I give away everything I own,
and even hand over my body to be burned,
but do not have love,
I gain nothing.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>What Love Is — and Is Not (13:4–7)</h3>

<p>
Love is patient.
Love is kind.
Love does not envy.
Love does not boast.
Love is not inflated.
</p>

<p>
Love does not behave shamefully,
does not seek its own advantage,
is not easily provoked,
and does not keep a record of wrongs.
</p>

<p>
Love does not rejoice in injustice,
but rejoices with the truth.
</p>

<p>
Love bears all things,
believes all things,
hopes all things,
endures all things.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>What Has Ended and What Remains (13:8–13)</h3>

<p>
Love never fails.
But prophecies have ceased.
Tongues have fallen silent.
Knowledge has passed away.
</p>

<p>
For we knew in part,
and we prophesied in part,
</p>

<p>
but when the complete arrived,
the partial passed away.
</p>

<p>
When I was a child,
I spoke like a child,
thought like a child,
reasoned like a child.
When I became mature,
I set aside childish things.
</p>

<p>
For we once saw in a mirror dimly,
but now face to face.
Once I knew in part,
but now I know fully,
just as I am fully known.
</p>

<p>
So now remain faith, hope, and love —
these three.
And the greatest of these is love.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Chapters 12–14 address spiritual gifts.
Chapter 13 is not a poetic interruption —
it is the interpretive centre.
Paul contrasts temporary covenant tools
with the permanent relational reality
of the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Love never fails” means it outlasts the old covenant structures</h3>
<p>
Paul contrasts love with gifts tied to a transitional age.
Prophecy, tongues, and partial knowledge
served a purpose during covenant change —
but love is not temporary.
It belongs to the completed order.
</p>

<h3>2) “The complete” is the arrived New Covenant reality</h3>
<p>
Paul does not point to a distant future.
“The complete” refers to the maturity
of New Covenant life in Christ —
the full unveiling of what was partial under the Law.
The paraphrase reflects this as fulfilled arrival.
</p>

<h3>3) “Face to face” is covenant clarity, not bodily sight</h3>
<p>
This echoes Old Testament language of relational access.
It describes unmediated relationship,
not physical eyesight.
The veil has been removed;
God is known directly in Christ.
</p>

<h3>4) Faith and hope remain — but love governs them</h3>
<p>
Faith and hope continue,
but love is greater because it is the environment
in which faith trusts and hope rests.
Love is not one virtue among others —
it is the atmosphere of the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Ceased / passed away” (13:8):</strong> completed transition, not future loss.</li>
  <li><strong>“The complete” (13:10):</strong> fulfilled covenant maturity.</li>
  <li><strong>“Face to face” (13:12):</strong> direct relational access, not physical vision.</li>
  <li><strong>“Remain” (13:13):</strong> what continues after transition is complete.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
The New Creation is not held together by gifts,
experiences, or knowledge.
It is held together by love —
patient, truthful, enduring love
that reflects the finished work of Christ.
Everything else served its purpose.
Love remains.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
If love is the permanent reality,
what temporary things am I still treating
as if they were central?
