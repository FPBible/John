<h1>1 Corinthians 5</h1>
<h2>Holiness as Identity · The End of Tolerated Corruption</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul addresses a case of sexual immorality so severe
that even the surrounding culture finds it offensive.
The community is not grieving — it is boasting.
Paul confronts this as a failure of identity, not a lack of rules.
</p>

<p>
Though absent in body, Paul declares a decisive judgment:
the behaviour cannot continue unchecked within the community.
The goal is not destruction,
but the exposure of what does not belong
so that restoration remains possible.
</p>

<p>
Paul invokes Passover imagery.
A little leaven works through the whole batch.
Christ, the Passover lamb, has already been sacrificed.
Therefore the community must live as it truly is — unleavened.
</p>

<p>
He clarifies that separation is not from the world,
but from persistent, unrepentant behaviour within the body.
God judges those outside.
The community is responsible for protecting its shared life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Corinth is confusing freedom with indifference.
Paul corrects this by showing that New Covenant freedom
does not ignore destructive behaviour.
It addresses it without reverting to law.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Judgment here is covenantal, not punitive</h3>
<p>
Paul is not handing someone over to eternal torment.
He is removing covenant protection
so the seriousness of the behaviour becomes visible.
This is corrective exposure, not vengeance.
</p>

<h3>2) “Deliver to Satan” is exclusion language</h3>
<p>
“Satan” functions here as the realm outside the covenant community —
the sphere where destructive patterns dominate.
The aim is repentance, not condemnation.
</p>

<h3>3) Leaven imagery assumes completion</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say, “Become unleavened.”
He says, “You are unleavened.”
Holiness flows from identity already established in Christ.
</p>

<h3>4) Separation protects life, not reputation</h3>
<p>
This is not image management.
It is community care.
Unchecked corruption spreads and damages everyone.
Love confronts for the sake of restoration.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Exodus 12 — Passover and leaven</li>
  <li>Galatians 5 — leaven and freedom</li>
  <li>Hebrews 12 — discipline as sonship</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Holiness is not enforced by fear.
It is protected by truth.
In Christ, the community does not pretend corruption is harmless.
It confronts it without losing sight of restoration.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be mistaking tolerance for love,
or silence for freedom?
</p>
