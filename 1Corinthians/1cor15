<h1>1 Corinthians 15</h1>
<h2>Resurrection Accomplished · Death Defeated</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul reminds the Corinthians of the gospel he delivered:
Christ died for sins according to the Scriptures,
was buried,
and was raised on the third day.
This message stands at the centre of their faith.
</p>

<p>
Resurrection is not optional.
If Christ was not raised,
faith collapses and death retains power.
But Christ has been raised,
becoming the firstfruits —
the guarantee that death’s reign is ending.
</p>

<p>
Paul frames resurrection covenantally.
Adam represents the old humanity under death.
Christ represents the new humanity made alive.
The last enemy to be destroyed is death itself.
</p>

<p>
Paul contrasts natural and spiritual bodies.
What is sown perishable is raised imperishable.
This is not the animation of corpses,
but transformation from old-order existence
into Spirit-shaped life.
</p>

<p>
He declares the mystery:
flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom.
Transformation is necessary.
Mortality gives way to immortality.
Death is swallowed up in victory.
</p>

<p>
The chapter ends with assurance.
Because resurrection is real and effective,
labour in the Lord is not empty.
The new reality is already active.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Some Corinthians deny resurrection,
likely rejecting covenant transformation language.
Paul shows that resurrection is essential
to the gospel itself,
not a speculative add-on.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Resurrection is covenant victory</h3>
<p>
Paul draws from Isaiah and Hosea.
Resurrection language announces
the defeat of death as a covenant power,
not merely personal survival.
</p>

<h3>2) “Firstfruits” implies an unfolding harvest</h3>
<p>
Christ’s resurrection inaugurates a process.
It guarantees the outcome.
The focus is corporate transformation,
not isolated events.
</p>

<h3>3) Adam and Christ represent covenant orders</h3>
<p>
Adam stands for life under law and death.
Christ stands for life in the Spirit.
This is about identity transfer,
not genetics.
</p>

<h3>4) Spiritual body means Spirit-governed life</h3>
<p>
Paul does not deny embodiment.
He redefines it.
The “spiritual body” is life animated by God’s Spirit,
not flesh ruled by decay.
</p>

<h3>5) Death’s defeat is declared, not postponed</h3>
<p>
“Death is swallowed up in victory”
is proclamation.
The old power structure has collapsed.
Life now reigns in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Isaiah 25 — death swallowed up</li>
  <li>Hosea 13 — victory over the grave</li>
  <li>Romans 6 — life in resurrection</li>
  <li>2 Corinthians 5 — new creation life</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Resurrection is not waiting to begin.
It is the ground you stand on.
Death no longer defines identity,
purpose, or hope.
Life in the Spirit is the present reality.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be living
as though death or futility has the final word?
</p>
