<h1>1 Corinthians — Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read This Letter (New Creation Lens)</h2>

<p>
1 Corinthians is not a law manual.
It is a New Covenant correction letter.
Paul addresses real dysfunction, not by reinstating Torah,
but by re-centering everything on Christ and the Spirit.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) This Letter Is About Identity Before Behaviour</h2>
<p>
Paul repeatedly corrects people by reminding them who they are:
sanctified in Christ,
temples of the Spirit,
members of one body,
participants in one table,
heirs of one victory.
When identity is lost, behaviour collapses.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) “Wisdom” vs “Cross” Is a World-Collision</h2>
<p>
Corinth loved status, rhetoric, and public dominance.
Paul dismantles that system with the cross.
The cross is not a religious symbol here.
It is the end of human boasting,
the collapse of old status games,
and the foundation of a new kind of community.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) The Spirit Is the Operating System</h2>
<p>
Paul does not tell them to build holiness by external pressure.
He tells them to walk in Spirit-life:
love, maturity, self-control, and edification.
Gifts are not for spectacle.
They are for building up the body.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Resurrection Language Must Be Read Covenantally</h2>
<p>
1 Corinthians 15 is the major “resurrection” chapter.
In this project, resurrection language is read the way Scripture uses it:
as victory, transformation, and covenant transition,
not necessarily as biological mechanics in a distant future.
Paul’s argument is that Christ’s victory has redefined life,
identity, and belonging in the new age.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How to Read 1 Corinthians Here</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the setting: a mixed community inside a collapsing old world</li>
  <li>Read correction through union, not through shame</li>
  <li>Let love be the interpretive centre (ch. 13)</li>
  <li>Read “resurrection” with the gospel’s finished work as the anchor</li>
</ul>

<p>
This letter is messy because people were messy.
The point is not perfection.
The point is New Covenant life replacing old identity systems.
</p>
