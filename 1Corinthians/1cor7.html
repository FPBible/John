<h1>1 Corinthians 7</h1>
<h2>Remain as You Are · Faithfulness in the Present</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul responds to questions about marriage, singleness, and intimacy.
He affirms marriage as good and mutual,
rejecting ascetic pressure that treats the body as a problem.
Husbands and wives belong to one another in shared care,
not control.
</p>

<p>
He distinguishes between the Lord’s teaching
and his own pastoral judgment,
addressing real situations within a time of pressure.
Separation is discouraged,
yet grace is extended where fracture already exists.
</p>

<p>
Paul advises believers to remain in the situation
in which they were called.
Circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing.
Social status does not define belonging.
Freedom in Christ relativises every earthly label.
</p>

<p>
Because of the present distress,
Paul commends singleness as a practical good,
not a spiritual superiority.
Marriage and singleness are both gifts,
to be lived faithfully without anxiety.
</p>

<p>
He frames everything with urgency:
the form of this world is passing.
Attachments must be held lightly,
so devotion to the Lord remains undivided.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Corinth is wrestling with competing pressures:
sexual license on one side and spiritualised abstinence on the other.
Paul cuts through both by anchoring faithfulness
in calling, not rule-making.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “Remain as you are” is freedom language</h3>
<p>
Paul is not freezing people in misery.
He is dismantling the idea that external change
secures spiritual standing.
Calling precedes circumstance.
</p>

<h3>2) Marriage is mutual, not hierarchical</h3>
<p>
Paul’s language is radically reciprocal for his time.
Authority is shared.
Care is mutual.
This reflects New Covenant life, not patriarchy.
</p>

<h3>3) “Present distress” shapes pastoral advice</h3>
<p>
Paul’s counsel is time-aware.
It recognises instability during a covenant transition,
not a timeless ban or command.
</p>

<h3>4) “The form of this world is passing”</h3>
<p>
This is covenant language.
The social-religious order tied to the old age
is losing its grip.
Life is to be lived alert, not anxious.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Galatians 3 — identity beyond status</li>
  <li>Matthew 19 — Jesus on marriage</li>
  <li>Romans 12 — living without conformity</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
You do not need a different life to live faithfully.
You need a renewed centre.
In Christ, every situation becomes a place
where devotion can be expressed without fear.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I be waiting for circumstances to change
instead of living faithfully where I am?
</p>
