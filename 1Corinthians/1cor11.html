<h1>1 Corinthians 11</h1>
<h2>Shared Honour · One Body at One Table</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Paul begins by addressing conduct in public worship.
His concern is not fashion or gender hierarchy,
but honour, order, and mutual respect
within the gathered community.
External symbols reflect relational realities,
not timeless dress codes.
</p>

<p>
He then confronts a serious failure at the Lord’s table.
What should express unity has become a display of division.
Some eat well while others go hungry.
The meal that proclaims Christ’s self-giving
is being contradicted by selfish behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Paul reminds them of the meaning of the meal:
participation in the body and blood of the Lord.
To eat without discerning the body
is to deny the very reality the meal announces.
</p>

<p>
Because of this failure to recognise one another,
the community experiences weakness and disruption.
Paul urges self-examination—not introspection,
but relational discernment—
so the gathering reflects the New Covenant life it proclaims.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Corinth’s social divisions are surfacing in worship.
Paul insists that covenant unity must be visible,
especially at the table that declares shared life in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Headship language is relational, not hierarchical</h3>
<p>
Paul is not constructing a chain of command.
He is addressing honour and representation
within a specific cultural setting.
The focus is mutuality and respect,
not permanent gender ranking.
</p>

<h3>2) The Lord’s Supper proclaims covenant reality</h3>
<p>
This meal announces participation in Christ’s death—
the end of the old order and the birth of a new one.
To eat selfishly is to deny the gospel enacted at the table.
</p>

<h3>3) “Discerning the body” means recognising the people</h3>
<p>
Paul is not urging mystical analysis of bread and wine.
He is calling the community to recognise one another
as the body of Christ.
Failure here fractures covenant life.
</p>

<h3>4) Judgment language is corrective, not condemning</h3>
<p>
Weakness and discipline function to restore,
not to destroy.
They expose contradiction so healing can occur.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key Cross-References</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Luke 22 — covenant meal</li>
  <li>Acts 2 — shared table life</li>
  <li>1 Corinthians 10 — participation and allegiance</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
The Lord’s table still confronts division.
It declares that no one eats alone,
no one outranks another,
and no one is invisible.
Unity is not an idea;
it is enacted.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
How might my participation in shared life
better reflect the unity Christ has already given?
</p>
