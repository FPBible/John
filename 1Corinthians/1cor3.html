<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Still Thinking Like the Old World (3:1–4)</h3>

<p>
Brothers, I could not speak to you as people living by the Spirit,
but as people still thinking according to the flesh —
like infants in Christ.
</p>

<p>
I fed you with milk, not solid food,
because you were not ready for it then —
and you still are not,
because jealousy and strife remain among you.
</p>

<p>
As long as you say, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,”
you are thinking in purely human categories.
</p>

<h3>God Is the One Producing Growth (3:5–9)</h3>

<p>
What then is Apollos?
What is Paul?
Servants through whom you believed,
each doing what the Lord assigned.
</p>

<p>
I planted.
Apollos watered.
But God has been giving the growth.
</p>

<p>
So neither the planter nor the waterer is anything —
only God who causes growth.
</p>

<p>
We are God’s fellow workers.
You are God’s field,
God’s building.
</p>

<h3>One Foundation, Tested Work (3:10–15)</h3>

<p>
According to the grace God has given me,
I laid a foundation like a skilled builder,
and someone else is building on it.
Each person should be careful how they build.
</p>

<p>
No one can lay any other foundation
than the one already laid —
Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Now if anyone builds on that foundation
with gold, silver, precious stones,
wood, hay, or straw,
</p>

<p>
each person’s work is being exposed for what it is.
The day is revealing it,
because it is being uncovered by fire —
and the fire is testing the quality of each person’s work.
</p>

<p>
If the work survives, the builder receives reward.
If the work is burned up, the builder suffers loss —
yet the builder himself is rescued,
though as through fire.
</p>

<h3>You Are God’s Temple (3:16–17)</h3>

<p>
Do you not recognise that you are God’s temple,
and that God’s Spirit is dwelling among you?
</p>

<p>
If anyone corrupts God’s temple,
God will bring that destruction upon them.
For God’s temple is holy —
and you are that temple.
</p>

<h3>The End of Worldly Boasting (3:18–23)</h3>

<p>
Let no one deceive themselves.
If anyone thinks they are wise by this age’s standards,
they must become “foolish” in order to become truly wise.
</p>

<p>
The wisdom of this world has already been shown to be foolishness with God.
Scripture says,
“He catches the wise in their craftiness,”
and,
“The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise —
that they are empty.”
</p>

<p>
So stop boasting in human leaders.
Everything already belongs to you —
Paul, Apollos, Cephas,
the world, life, death,
the present, the future —
all are yours,
</p>

<p>
and you belong to Christ,
and Christ belongs to God.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>

<p>
Paul is still addressing division,
but now he exposes its deeper issue:
immaturity.
The Corinthians are measuring leadership,
wisdom, and success using an order that has already been judged by the cross.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “The day” is present evaluation, not distant apocalypse</h3>
<p>
“The day” (3:13) is not a future cosmic event.
It refers to God’s present evaluative exposure of ministry work
within the unfolding New Covenant era.
The fire imagery describes testing, not eternal punishment.
</p>

<h3>2) Fire tests work, not people</h3>
<p>
Paul is explicit: the fire tests the quality of what is built,
not the identity of the builder.
The person remains safe in Christ,
even if their work proves empty.
</p>

<h3>3) Temple language is already fulfilled</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say believers <em>will become</em> God’s temple.
He insists they already are.
This reflects the completed shift from physical temple to Spirit-indwelt community.
</p>

<h3>4) Judgment language is covenantal and constructive</h3>
<p>
Destruction language (3:17) is directed toward those harming the community
by reintroducing old-world categories of power and division.
This is covenant discipline, not afterlife threat.
</p>

<h2>Key Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Flesh” (3:1–3):</strong> old covenant, human-based identity patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>“Fire” (3:13):</strong> testing exposure, not eternal torment.</li>
  <li><strong>“Temple” (3:16):</strong> the community as God’s dwelling place, replacing the old system.</li>
  <li><strong>“This age” (3:18):</strong> a wisdom system already judged and passing.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Maturity in the New Creation is not knowledge accumulation.
It is freedom from comparison,
freedom from personality allegiance,
and confidence in God’s work rather than our own constructions.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Where am I still measuring success using categories the cross has already dismantled?
