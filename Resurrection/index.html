    <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> In the Bible, resurrection is God’s covenantal victory over “death” (condemnation/exile under the Law), climaxing at the end of the age in the first-century transition, producing the New Creation life now.</p>
    <p class="ref"><strong>Key texts:</strong> 1 Cor 15; Rom 5–8; 2 Cor 3–5; Eph 2; Col 2–3; Heb 8–10, 12; Dan 12; Ezek 37; Isa 25–26; Rev 20–22; Matt 24; Luke 21.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Define the Bible’s “Death” and “Life”</h2>
  <p>
    Scripture regularly uses “death” and “life” as covenant realities, not merely biological states.
  </p>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>Death as condemnation/exile</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“The ministry of death, engraved on stones” (2 Cor 3:7)</li>
        <li>“The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law” (1 Cor 15:56)</li>
        <li>“You were dead in…sins” (Eph 2:1–5)</li>
        <li>“The mind of the flesh is death” (Rom 8:6)</li>
        <li>“The wages of sin is death” (Rom 6:23)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Life as restored access/union</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Made us alive together with Christ…raised us up” (Eph 2:5–6)</li>
        <li>“If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation” (2 Cor 5:17)</li>
        <li>“You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ” (Col 3:3)</li>
        <li>“Passed out of death into life” (John 5:24)</li>
        <li>“He who has the Son has the life” (1 John 5:11–12)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>2) The Old Testament Backdrop: Corporate “Raising” Imagery</h2>
  <p>
    The prophets often describe covenant restoration using resurrection language.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ezekiel 37</strong> — Israel’s restoration pictured as bones coming to life (Ezek 37:1–14)</li>
    <li><strong>Isaiah 26</strong> — “Your dead shall live” in the context of deliverance and vindication (Isa 26:19)</li>
    <li><strong>Isaiah 25</strong> — death “swallowed up” with covenant comfort for God’s people (Isa 25:6–9)</li>
    <li><strong>Hosea 6</strong> — “After two days…on the third day he will raise us up” (Hos 6:1–2)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      These passages are not presented as random biology lessons. They are covenant images:
      death/exile → restoration/life; shame → vindication; separation → access.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>3) Daniel 12 and “the End”: Resurrection Tied to the Covenant Crisis</h2>
  <p>
    Daniel’s resurrection language is anchored to a specific time of national trouble and deliverance.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“There shall be a time of trouble…at that time your people shall be delivered” (Dan 12:1)</li>
    <li>“Many of those who sleep…shall awake” (Dan 12:2)</li>
    <li>End markers: “at the end of the days” / the finishing of Daniel’s vision (Dan 12:4, 9, 13)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In the New Testament, Jesus and the apostles place the climactic “end” within the first-century generation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“This generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished” (Matt 24:34; Luke 21:32)</li>
    <li>“The end of the ages has come” (1 Cor 10:11)</li>
    <li>“It is the last hour” (1 John 2:18)</li>
    <li>“The consummation of the ages” (Heb 9:26)</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>4) 1 Corinthians 15: What Resurrection Does (and What It Isn’t)</h2>
  <p>
    Paul’s chapter is the spine for resurrection doctrine. Read it in Paul’s own categories:
    Adam/Christ, death/life, corruption/incorruption, earthly/heavenly.
  </p>

  <h3>A) Resurrection and the defeat of “death”</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“As in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive” (1 Cor 15:22)</li>
    <li>“The last enemy that will be abolished is death” (1 Cor 15:26)</li>
    <li>“The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law” (1 Cor 15:56)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Paul locates death’s authority in <em>sin empowered by the Law</em>. Resurrection therefore includes the removal of that condemning power.
  </p>

  <h3>B) “Flesh and blood” and the kind of body</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“Flesh and blood can’t inherit the Kingdom of God” (1 Cor 15:50)</li>
    <li>“It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body” (1 Cor 15:44)</li>
    <li>“The first man is of the earth… the second man is of heaven” (1 Cor 15:47)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Paul contrasts two modes of humanity: Adamic (earthly/condemned) and Christic (heavenly/life).
    The resurrection body is the <strong>new covenant identity</strong> of God’s people in Christ.
  </p>

  <h3>C) Timing anchored to “the end”</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“Then comes the end” (1 Cor 15:24)</li>
    <li>“We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed” (1 Cor 15:51)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Paul speaks as a first-century apostle within the “end of the age” horizon (1 Cor 10:11; Heb 9:26).
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5) “Already Raised” Texts: Resurrection as Present Reality</h2>
  <p>
    The New Testament repeatedly speaks of resurrection life as something believers possess now.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Made us alive… and raised us up with him” (Eph 2:5–6)</li>
    <li>“Buried with him… raised with him through faith” (Col 2:12–13)</li>
    <li>“If then you were raised together with Christ” (Col 3:1–4)</li>
    <li>“Has passed out of death into life” (John 5:24)</li>
    <li>“We know that we have passed out of death into life” (1 John 3:14)</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      If resurrection is only future, these passages become awkward or “just positional talk.”
      Scripture treats them as real: a present participation in Christ’s victory.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>6) Hebrews: The Covenant Shift That Ends the Old “Death-Order”</h2>
  <p>
    Hebrews frames the transition from the old system to the new as an actual shift of access, standing, and covenant reality.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Old covenant “becoming old and growing aged” and “near to vanishing away” (Heb 8:13)</li>
    <li>Christ appears “at the consummation of the ages” to put away sin (Heb 9:26)</li>
    <li>One offering perfects forever and removes the need for repeat sacrifices (Heb 10:10–14)</li>
    <li>“The way into the holy place was not yet made manifest” while the first tabernacle stood (Heb 9:8)</li>
    <li>Believers come to the heavenly Jerusalem now (Heb 12:22–24)</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>7) Revelation: Death Removed, Life Unveiled</h2>
  <p>
    Revelation’s arc moves from covenant judgment to New Creation life: the removal of death’s rule and the unveiling of God-with-us.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection” (Rev 20:6)</li>
    <li>“Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire” (Rev 20:14)</li>
    <li>New creation climax: “death will be no more” (Rev 21:4)</li>
    <li>“Behold, I make all things new” (Rev 21:5)</li>
    <li>“The tabernacle of God is with men” (Rev 21:3)</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>8) What Resurrection Means Now</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> condemnation is not your operating environment (Rom 8:1–4)</li>
    <li><strong>Identity:</strong> you are new creation, not “old man with a religious add-on” (2 Cor 5:17; Eph 4:22–24)</li>
    <li><strong>Holiness:</strong> you live from life, not fear of death (Rom 6:4–11; Col 3:1–10)</li>
    <li><strong>Assurance:</strong> resurrection life is Christ’s present gift (John 11:25–26; 1 John 5:11–13)</li>
    <li><strong>Mission:</strong> reconciliation is the fruit of resurrection life (2 Cor 5:18–21)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Plainly:</strong> we don’t “wait to become alive.” We live because life has been given. Resurrection is not a distant carrot; it is the covenant reality of the New Creation in Christ.</p>
