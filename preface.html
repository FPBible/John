<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>How to Read This Gospel</h2>

<p>
This work is a paraphrased presentation of the Gospel of John,
written from the conviction that John’s message speaks primarily
from within its own historical horizon and announces realities that
are present, active, and complete in Christ.
</p>

<p>
John does not write to speculate about distant futures.
He writes to proclaim life that has arrived,
light that has entered the world,
judgment that is already at work,
and glory that is being revealed through the Son.
</p>

<p>
For that reason, this paraphrase avoids reading John
as if his language were mainly predictive or deferred.
Instead, the Gospel is allowed to speak in its own tense —
declaring what Christ has accomplished,
what He has inaugurated,
and what His followers are invited to live within now.
</p>

<h2>Paraphrase and Commentary</h2>

<p>
The narrative portions of this work remain close to the flow and structure
of the biblical text.
Interpretive expansion has been intentionally restrained.
Where John speaks with poetic ambiguity,
that ambiguity has been preserved.
</p>

<p>
The fulfilled perspective is made explicit in the commentary sections,
not embedded into the narrative itself.
This separation allows readers to distinguish clearly between
the story John tells
and the theological implications that flow from it.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment and the New Creation</h2>

<p>
Throughout the Gospel,
John speaks repeatedly of:
life already given,
judgment already present,
glory already shared,
and access already opened.
These are not treated here as promises waiting for completion,
but as realities rooted in the work of Christ
and unfolding within the lives of His first hearers.
</p>

<p>
This approach understands fulfillment
not as the cancellation of hope,
but as its realization.
The New Creation is not postponed to another age;
it is revealed through the risen Christ
and lived through union with Him.
</p>

<h2>A Word on History</h2>

<p>
While the historical transition between old and new covenant realities
forms an important backdrop to this reading,
this work does not aim to argue timelines or construct prophetic charts.
Historical fulfillment is acknowledged where it clarifies the text,
but the focus remains on what John proclaims:
that the Word has become flesh,
that light has overcome darkness,
and that life is available now in the Son.
</p>

<h2>An Invitation</h2>

<p>
This Gospel is offered not as a system to master,
but as a testimony to receive.
John writes so that readers may believe,
and in believing, have life.
That purpose remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>
Read slowly.
Attend to the language.
Let the Gospel speak.
</p>

<p>
The invitation is not to wait for life,
but to recognise it.
</p>
