<h1>Life</h1>
<h2>Eternal Life as Present Covenant Reality</h2>

<p>
In Scripture, <strong>life</strong> is not defined by biological function,
future location, or post-mortem speculation.
It is defined by <strong>access, union, and participation in God</strong>.
</p>

<p class="note">
This page governs how “life”, “eternal life”, “alive”, “living”, and “perish” language
is read throughout FPBible.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Life Is a Covenant Category Before It Is a Biological One</h2>

<p>
From the beginning of Scripture, <em>life</em> is framed relationally.
Adam is created alive biologically, yet Scripture measures his life by
<strong>presence with God</strong>, not by respiration.
</p>

<p>
When Adam is expelled from the garden, he does not cease to exist.
But he is cut off from the place of life.
The biblical pattern is established early:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Life</strong> = access, communion, inheritance</li>
  <li><strong>Death</strong> = exile, separation, condemnation</li>
</ul>

<p>
This covenant meaning governs Israel’s story.
To be “alive” is to belong, to dwell, to stand before God.
To be “cut off” is to be dead — even while breathing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Life Under the Law Was Conditional and Fragile</h2>

<p>
Under the Mosaic Covenant, life was always <strong>conditional</strong>.
It depended on obedience, sacrifice, priesthood, and temple mediation.
</p>

<p>
This is why Scripture repeatedly speaks of Israel as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>living yet “dead”</li>
  <li>near yet excluded</li>
  <li>chosen yet condemned</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Law could define life, but it could not <em>give</em> life.
It could promise blessing, but it could not secure permanence.
It produced a people who were always:
<strong>alive by provision, not by union</strong>.
</p>

<p class="note">
This tension is deliberate. The Law exposes the problem.
It does not solve it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Jesus Does Not Offer Life Later — He Announces Life Arriving</h2>

<p>
When Jesus speaks of <em>life</em> and <em>eternal life</em>,
He does so to people who are physically alive.
That alone should settle the issue.
</p>

<p>
“Eternal life” is not defined by duration,
but by <strong>source and quality</strong>.
It is the life of the age to come — the life of the New Covenant —
breaking into the present.
</p>

<p>
Jesus repeatedly locates life in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>knowing the Father</li>
  <li>abiding in Him</li>
  <li>eating and drinking His life</li>
  <li>believing and passing from death into life</li>
</ul>

<p>
None of this language points forward to a post-death reward.
It announces a <strong>transfer of covenant status</strong>
from death to life in the present.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Eternal Life Is Life Beyond Condemnation</h2>

<p>
Throughout the New Testament, <em>life</em> is consistently contrasted
not with physical dying, but with <strong>condemnation</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This is decisive.
If “life” meant “never biologically dying,”
Paul’s arguments collapse.
Bodies still die.
Yet Paul insists believers already possess life.
</p>

<p>
The contrast is covenantal:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Death</strong> — under Law, accusation, exile</li>
  <li><strong>Life</strong> — in Christ, justified, reconciled</li>
</ul>

<p>
Life is the condition of being <em>no longer under judgment</em>.
It is the state of standing accepted, not threatened.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. Life in the Spirit Replaces Life Under the Law</h2>

<p>
Paul’s language is exact.
Life is now located in the Spirit,
not in the flesh, not in Torah identity,
not in ethnic or covenant boundary markers.
</p>

<p>
To live “according to the Spirit” does not mean mystical intensity.
It means living from a <strong>new covenant location</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>no mediator required</li>
  <li>no sacrifice pending</li>
  <li>no condemnation hanging overhead</li>
</ul>

<p>
Life in the Spirit is not something to achieve.
It is something to <strong>recognise and walk from</strong>.
</p>

<p class="note">
This is why New Testament exhortation flows from identity,
not threat.
Life is assumed, not dangled.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6. “Perishing” Language Does Not Cancel Life</h2>

<p>
Biblical warnings about “perishing” are covenantal,
not metaphysical.
They describe loss, judgment, and exclusion
within the Old Covenant world —
especially in the AD 30–70 transition period.
</p>

<p>
They do not redefine life as uncertain or fragile.
They warn that rejecting Christ during that period
meant remaining in a world that was passing away.
</p>

<p>
Once that world ended, the framework closed.
Life is no longer something to miss by timing.
It is the settled reality of the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>7. What Life Means Now</h2>

<p>
To say believers have life now is not poetry.
It is a theological claim with consequences.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Life is not interrupted by death</li>
  <li>Life is not suspended awaiting judgment</li>
  <li>Life is not fragile or provisional</li>
  <li>Life is not maintained by fear</li>
</ul>

<p>
Life is participation in Christ’s own standing before the Father.
It is the shared life of the Son.
</p>

<p class="note">
This does not deny grief, loss, or mortality.
It denies that any of those undo union.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8. Life as the Governing Reality</h2>

<p>
If life is misunderstood, the gospel collapses into:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>delay theology</li>
  <li>fear-based motivation</li>
  <li>endless introspection</li>
  <li>unfinished redemption</li>
</ul>

<p>
If life is understood covenantally:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>assurance replaces anxiety</li>
  <li>obedience flows from freedom</li>
  <li>holiness becomes expression, not survival</li>
  <li>faith becomes lived trust, not future hope</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Life in Scripture is relational and covenantal</li>
  <li>Life under the Law was conditional and fragile</li>
  <li>Jesus announces life arriving, not life delayed</li>
  <li>Eternal life is present participation, not post-death timing</li>
  <li>Life in the Spirit replaces life under condemnation</li>
</ul>
