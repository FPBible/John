  <h1>Satan — The Covenantal Accuser</h1>
  <p class="kicker">
    “Satan” in Scripture is best read as a functional title—adversary / accuser—operating within Israel’s covenant world,
    fulfilled and ended in the AD 30–70 transition.
  </p>
</header>

<main>

    <h2>Plain</h2>
    <p>
      In the Bible, <strong>satan</strong> (Hebrew: <em>sawtawn</em>) means <strong>adversary</strong> or <strong>accuser</strong>.
      It describes opposition in a legal or covenantal setting: bringing a charge, challenging standing, pressing a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read this way, “Satan” is not a rival deity and not a required “cosmic villain template” for every passage.
      Scripture repeatedly presents an <strong>accusing function</strong>—a prosecutor-like role—tied to covenant life,
      covenant guilt, and covenant administration.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Accusation is covenantal.</strong> When the Old Covenant reached its end, the court that sustained accusation ended with it.
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="meaning">
    <h2>What the Word Means</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible uses <strong>satan</strong> language for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adversary</strong> — an opposer (sometimes human, sometimes an appointed agent)</li>
      <li><strong>Accuser</strong> — one who brings a charge</li>
      <li><strong>Legal challenge</strong> — testing motives, standing, or covenant faithfulness</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Context decides the referent. The definition stays stable: <em>opposition / accusation</em>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="job">
    <h2>Job: “The Satan” in a Judicial Scene</h2>
    <p>
      In Job 1–2, “the sons of God” present themselves, and <strong>the satan</strong> is among them.
      The narrative is structured like a hearing: motives are questioned, integrity is tested, and limits are set.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The accuser appears <strong>within</strong> the administration and <strong>under boundaries</strong>.
      The function is prosecutorial, not autonomous rule.

  <section class="card" id="zechariah">
    <h2>Zechariah 3: Accusation and Covenant Cleansing</h2>
    <p>
      Zechariah 3 is the cleanest “accuser” snapshot. Joshua the high priest stands in filthy garments (covenant defilement),
      and <strong>the satan stands to accuse</strong>. The LORD rebukes the accuser and removes the filth—restoring Joshua as a sign
      of covenant cleansing and transition.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      This is covenant courtroom language: <strong>charge</strong>, <strong>defilement</strong>, <strong>rebuke</strong>,
      <strong>cleansing</strong>, <strong>restoration</strong>.

    <h2>Christ in the Wilderness: Covenant Tested and Exhausted</h2>

    <p>
      The temptation of Jesus in the wilderness is not a display of cosmic warfare.
      It is the <strong>final covenantal testing</strong> of Israel’s true Son while the Law still possessed authority to accuse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jesus enters the wilderness immediately after being declared “Son.”
      This deliberately mirrors Israel’s forty years in the wilderness, now compressed into forty days.
      Where Israel failed under covenant pressure, Jesus remains faithful.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The confrontation is covenantal, not metaphysical.
      Sonship is questioned, obedience is tested, and authority is probed.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Each challenge presses Jesus to step outside covenant trust:
      to secure provision apart from the Father,
      to force divine validation through spectacle,
      and to seize authority before its appointed fulfillment.
      Jesus responds exclusively from <strong>Deuteronomy</strong> — Israel’s covenant document —
      showing the dispute belongs entirely within the Law’s framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      This scene represents the <strong>last lawful testing</strong> under the Old Covenant.
      The accuser is permitted to question, but unable to establish guilt.
      From this point forward, accusation begins its collapse toward the cross,
      where the covenant’s power to prosecute is exhausted.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The wilderness temptation is not a template for ongoing Christian experience.
      It belongs to the closing moments of the Old Covenant, resolved in Christ and rendered obsolete with the covenant’s end.

    <h2>The New Testament: From Accusation to Reconciliation</h2>
    <p>
      The New Testament continues using courtroom and covenant vocabulary: <em>charge</em>, <em>testimony</em>,
      <em>condemnation</em>, <em>vindication</em>. The gospel is not a fear story. It is an announcement:
      the decisive verdict has been issued in Christ.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Condemnation is removed</strong> — the covenant sentence is exhausted, replaced with reconciliation.</li>
      <li><strong>Standing is secured</strong> — not by self-defense, but by Christ’s faithfulness and victory.</li>
      <li><strong>The “court” is surpassed</strong> — New Covenant life is not managed by a prosecuting system.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      The accuser’s “power” is the covenant’s power to prosecute.
      When the covenant ended, prosecution ended.
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="fulfilled">
    <h2>Fulfilled: Why This Ends in AD 70</h2>
    <p>
      Under FPBible’s Prophecy Hub standard, prophecy reaches completion in the first-century covenant transition (AD 30–70).
      The Old Covenant “world” (its heaven-and-earth order) concluded, and the temple-centered system that maintained ritual standing,
      condemnation, and exclusion collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That matters here because the accuser role is not free-floating. It belongs to a covenant court.
      When the covenant order ended, the jurisdiction ended.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>No court, no prosecutor.</strong><br />
      With the Old Covenant ended, the role called “the accuser” has no jurisdiction.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>So What Now?</h2>
    <p>
      This is not wordplay. It’s pastoral clarity.
      If you live as though accusation still governs reality, you will read the gospel through fear and self-defense.
      The New Covenant does the opposite.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are not living under an ongoing covenant prosecution.</li>
      <li>You are not required to “prove” sonship through spectacle, striving, or anxiety.</li>
      <li>You are living under reconciliation—clean standing, open access, real peace.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      The New Creation is not “no conflict.” It is <strong>no condemnation</strong>.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Satan</strong> in Scripture functions as <strong>adversary / accuser</strong>—a legal role.</li>
      <li>Job and Zechariah show a courtroom pattern: accusation inside a bounded system.</li>
      <li>The wilderness temptation is the last major covenantal testing under the Law’s authority.</li>
      <li>In Christ, accusation collapses toward the cross and ends with the covenant’s conclusion.</li>
      <li>AD 70 marks the end of the Old Covenant court—therefore the end of its prosecutor role.</li>
