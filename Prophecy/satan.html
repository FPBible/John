<h1>Satan</h1>
<h2>Adversary · Accuser · Apostate Authority</h2>

<p class="note">
In Scripture, “Satan” is not introduced as an independent supernatural rival to God.
It is a <strong>covenantal-legal function</strong>: adversary and accuser operating within
recognized authority structures. In the first century, this function is embodied in an
<strong>apostate religious hierarchy</strong> that prosecutes, condemns, and kills.
Christ dethrones that authority, closes the court, and reigns as
<strong>King and High Priest</strong> in the New Covenant.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) The Meaning of the Term: Function, Not Biography</h2>

<p>
The Hebrew word <em>satan</em> means <strong>adversary</strong> or <strong>accuser</strong>.
Scripture uses it functionally:
</p>

<ul class="tight">
  <li>for human opposition</li>
  <li>for obstructing or resisting forces</li>
  <li>for legal accusation within covenant courts</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Hebrew Bible provides no origin story, no fall-from-heaven narrative,
and no independent evil kingdom for Satan.
The emphasis is consistently on <strong>accusation with authority</strong>,
not metaphysical speculation.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) “Sons of God” = Covenantal / Religious Assembly</h2>

<p>
“Sons of God” language in Scripture refers to those who stand in relation to God’s authority
within a covenantal framework: representatives, leaders, judges, and priests.
It does not describe a species of celestial beings meeting in outer space.
</p>

<p>
Biblical assemblies function as <strong>religious courts</strong>.
Such courts include accusers by design.
Accusation is part of covenant enforcement.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Satan in Job: Accusation Within the Assembly</h2>

<p>
In Job 1–2, the “sons of God” assemble in a covenantal-judicial setting.
Within that assembly, <em>the satan</em> functions as the accuser —
challenging righteousness and prosecuting the case against Job.
</p>

<p>
This scene establishes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Job as a righteous covenant participant</li>
  <li>the assembly as recognized authority</li>
  <li>the satan as prosecutorial opposition</li>
  <li>God as the final judge</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nothing in Job presents Satan as an autonomous rebel.
The accuser operates <strong>within</strong> the system, not against God’s sovereignty.
This is covenantal jurisprudence, not cosmic mythology.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Zechariah 3: Accusation and Corrupt Priesthood</h2>

<p>
Zechariah 3 shows the accuser standing against the high priest.
God rebukes the accuser and restores the priest with cleansing and new garments.
</p>

<p>
This text does not claim that priests never accuse.
Under the Old Covenant, priesthood frequently became corrupt and functioned as a
<strong>prosecutorial authority</strong> rather than a restorative one.
</p>

<p>
The satanic role is therefore not defined by a job title (“priest” or “non-priest”),
but by function:
<strong>accusation that resists cleansing, restoration, and life</strong>.
That function can be embodied by corrupt religious leadership.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) Embodiment in Jesus’ Day: The Accusing Hierarchy</h2>

<p>
By the first century, the adversarial function is fully embodied in an
apostate religious hierarchy that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>polices covenant identity through accusation</li>
  <li>maintains authority through condemnation</li>
  <li>manipulates courts and testimony</li>
  <li>hands over the righteous to death</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is why Satan-language in the Gospels is inseparable from
trials, false witnesses, betrayal, and execution.
The accuser now wears robes, cites Scripture,
and claims covenant legitimacy.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) Christ Takes the Authority: King and High Priest</h2>

<p>
The Gospel announces not the defeat of a monster,
but the <strong>replacement of an order</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>As King</strong>, Christ receives all authority and displaces hostile rule.</li>
  <li><strong>As High Priest</strong>, He secures permanent cleansing and access.</li>
  <li><strong>As Mediator</strong>, He ends condemnation by closing the court.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The accuser’s power depended on jurisdiction.
That jurisdiction ends in Christ.
Where there is no condemning court, accusation has no standing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>7) The Dragon Cast Down: Revelation as Dethronement</h2>

<p>
Revelation defines the dragon explicitly as
<strong>“the accuser of our brothers.”</strong>
This is courtroom language, not zoology.
</p>

<p>
The dragon being “cast down” means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>loss of authority</li>
  <li>loss of standing</li>
  <li>loss of jurisdiction</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the dethronement of the apostate persecuting system
during the covenant transition.
The Lamb reigns; the accuser is silenced.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8) Why This Matters</h2>

<p>
The Gospel is not an invitation to endless spiritual warfare.
It is the announcement that accusation has lost authority,
condemnation has ended,
and New Creation life now stands secure in Christ.
</p>
