<h2>4) Zechariah 3: Accusation Resisted, Restoration Enacted</h2>

<p>
Zechariah 3 presents a covenantal courtroom scene focused on standing, accusation,
and restoration. The high priest is in view, clothed in defilement, while the accuser
stands to prosecute and oppose renewal.

<p>
The defining feature of the satanic role in this scene is not identity but function:
<strong>accusation that resists cleansing and restoration</strong>.
The accuser represents the prosecutorial voice within the covenant order that seeks to
maintain condemnation rather than permit renewal.
</p>

<p>
God’s response is decisive. The accuser is rebuked, the priest is cleansed,
new garments are given, and covenant standing is restored.
The narrative establishes a clear theological movement:
<strong>accusation is silenced so restoration can proceed</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This scene reinforces the broader biblical pattern:
when God acts to restore and renew covenant life,
the accusatory authority that opposes restoration is judged and displaced.
