<h1>Satan</h1>
<h2>Adversary · Accuser · Covenant Opponent</h2>

<p class="note">
“Satan” is not originally a proper noun. It is a title/function meaning
<strong>adversary</strong> or <strong>accuser</strong>.
Scripture uses the term in courtroom, covenant, and conflict settings.
If you start with “Satan = a red-horned immortal villain,” you will misread half the Bible.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) The Word Itself: Not a Proper Name</h2>

<p>
In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word is <em>satan</em> — “adversary.”
It can be used with or without the definite article:
</p>

<ul class="tight">
  <li><strong>“a satan”</strong> — an adversary (a role/description)</li>
  <li><strong>“the satan”</strong> — the adversary/accuser in a legal setting (a function)</li>
</ul>

<p>
That means “Satan” begins as a job description, not a personal identity label.
Later tradition turns it into a capital-S proper noun.
The Bible’s own usage is more varied and more functional than that.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) Satan Can Refer to Human Opposition</h2>

<p>
Scripture can use “adversary” language for ordinary opposition —
including human conflict. The term is not locked to one being.
What matters is the function: resistance, accusation, obstruction.
</p>

<p>
This is crucial: if “satan” can describe adversarial action in general,
then you should not automatically read every “satan” reference as a cosmic monster.
Context decides.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) “The Satan” in Courtroom/Covenant Scenes</h2>

<p>
Two key Old Testament scenes define the category:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Job 1–2</strong> — “the satan” appears as an accuser within a courtroom framework.</li>
  <li><strong>Zechariah 3</strong> — “the satan” accuses the high priest; God rebukes the accuser and restores the priest.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notice what’s happening: accusation, legality, priesthood, standing, cleansing, restoration.
That’s covenant vocabulary, not fantasy mythology.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Satan’s Power Runs Through Accusation</h2>

<p>
Across Scripture, the adversary/accuser function is tied to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>legal standing</li>
  <li>condemnation</li>
  <li>fear</li>
  <li>death</li>
</ul>

<p>
In New Testament terms, accusation is not “just feelings.”
It is a power structure: a world of condemnation built on a system that prosecutes.
The Gospel does not merely comfort the accused —
it ends the courtroom’s authority over those in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) Satan in the Gospels: The Conflict of Ages</h2>

<p>
In the Gospels, “Satan” language clusters around:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>temptation/testing (wilderness)</li>
  <li>opposition to Jesus’ mission</li>
  <li>accusation and condemnation structures</li>
  <li>the leadership’s drive to kill the Son</li>
</ul>

<p>
This does not require reading Satan as a cartoon figure.
It does require recognising that an adversarial power is operating —
often through a covenant system that condemns,
and through leadership that protects it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) “Devil” and “Satan” (Don’t Flatten Them)</h2>

<p>
The New Testament uses multiple terms that are often blurred in English:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>diabolos</strong> (“devil”) — slanderer, false accuser</li>
  <li><strong>satanas</strong> (“satan”) — adversary, opponent</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both terms lean toward accusation, slander, and opposition.
They describe what the adversarial power does:
it lies, it slanders, it prosecutes, it pushes toward death.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>7) “The Ruler of This World” in John</h2>

<p>
John’s Gospel uses the phrase “the ruler of this world.”
Jesus says this ruler is being judged and cast out (John 12),
and that his judgment is tied to the cross.
</p>

<p>
Read that carefully: this is not “sometime later.”
It is framed as imminent within Jesus’ ministry.
The cross exposes and ends the authority of the accuser.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8) Satan, Law, and Condemnation (The Covenant Link)</h2>

<p>
In a fulfilled/covenantal lens, Satan’s prosecuting function is inseparable from a condemning system.
Accusation requires a courtroom.
Condemnation requires an authority structure.
</p>

<p>
When the covenant order that administered condemnation reaches its end,
the accuser loses standing.
This is why New Testament writers can speak of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>disarming powers</li>
  <li>ending condemnation</li>
  <li>liberation from fear of death</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Gospel does not just “fight Satan.”
It removes the legal weaponry and identity structures that gave accusation power.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>9) Satan’s “End” and Fulfillment</h2>

<p>
The New Testament places decisive defeat within:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus’ ministry (authority exercised)</li>
  <li>the cross (judgment executed)</li>
  <li>the resurrection (life established)</li>
  <li>the covenant transition (old order removed)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not “God will eventually win.”
This is “God has won — live accordingly.”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>10) How to Use This Page</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When a text mentions “devil/satan,” ask: <strong>what is the function here?</strong> (accusation? opposition? testing?)</li>
  <li>Ask: <strong>is this courtroom/covenant language?</strong></li>
  <li>Ask: <strong>is this tied to the old order’s authority and its collapse?</strong></li>
  <li>Then interpret the symbol by Scripture’s own patterns — not later folklore.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
“Satan” is a title — adversary/accuser — not originally a personal proper name.
Scripture uses it functionally and covenantally.
In the Gospel, Christ exposes, judges, and dismantles the accusatory power
by ending condemnation and establishing New Creation life.
