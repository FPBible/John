    This page is written to settle one foundational question:
    <b>Does Sinai still have jurisdiction over believers in Christ?</b>
    The FP Bible answer is direct: <b>No.</b>
    Christ fulfilled the Mosaic covenant, removed its legal claims, and established the New Covenant reality
    that matured through the first-century covenant transition (AD 30–70).
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <b>Why this matters:</b>
    Many modern systems (especially <b>covenant theology</b> and <b>theonomy</b>) end up reinstalling Sinai as the governing framework.
    That move reshapes how people read Jesus, Paul, Hebrews, prophecy, ethics, and even “holiness.”
    If Sinai still rules, the cross did not actually change covenant jurisdiction.
  </div>

  <div class="key">
    <h2>Core Thesis</h2>
    <p>
      The Mosaic Law was a <b>covenant administration</b> given to Israel, tied to temple, priesthood, sacrifices, land,
      and national boundary-markers. It was never presented as an eternal constitution for the nations or the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Christ, that covenant reached its intended goal and termination:
      <b>its condemning “handwriting of requirements” was removed</b>
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:14</a>),
      and believers now live under the New Covenant administration of the Spirit
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.2Co3.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>).
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>What “End of the Law” Means (and What It Doesn’t)</h2>

  <h3>It means</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Jurisdiction changed:</b> believers are no longer under Mosaic covenant authority
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:14</a>;
      <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:18</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Condemnation ended:</b> the Law’s prosecuting power over covenant members is finished in Christ
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom7.1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 7:1–6</a>;
      <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:14</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Identity changed:</b> the people of God are defined by union with Christ, not Sinai boundary-markers
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 3</a>;
      <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Eph2.11-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ephesians 2:11–22</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Worship changed:</b> temple/priests/sacrifices give way to the once-for-all priesthood and offering of Christ
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Heb7-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 7–10</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>It does <i>not</i> mean</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      “Anything goes.” The New Covenant produces real holiness—by the Spirit, not by Sinai’s code
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8</a>;
      <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      God changed character. What changed is covenant administration and legal standing, not God’s goodness
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Jas1.17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James 1:17</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Morality disappears. It means morality is no longer enforced through the Mosaic covenant structure
      (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.2Co3.3-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 3:3–11</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Texts (Plain Reading)</h2>

  <h3>Colossians 2:14–17 — Removed, Not Retained</h3>
  <p class="ref">
    Paul says the “handwriting of requirements” was <b>taken out of the way</b>, nailed to the cross, and therefore believers are not to be judged
    by food, drink, feast, new moon, or sabbath—shadow-things fulfilled in Christ
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.14-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:14–17</a>).
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    This is not “the Law fulfilled but still binding.” It is “the Law’s legal claim removed; the shadows completed.”
  </p>

  <h3>Romans 7:1–6 — Covenant Death Ends Jurisdiction</h3>
  <p class="ref">
    Paul argues like a lawyer: law has dominion only as long as the person lives. Through union with Christ’s death,
    believers become “dead to the law” to belong to Another and bear fruit to God
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom7.1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 7:1–6</a>).
  </p>

  <h3>2 Corinthians 3 — The Ministry That Faded</h3>
  <p class="ref">
    Paul contrasts the ministry engraved on stones with the ministry of the Spirit. He calls the former a ministry of death/condemnation,
    and says it was fading as the new covenant glory remained
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.2Co3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 3</a>).
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    If something is “fading/obsolete,” you don’t repackage it as the Christian rule of life.
  </p>

  <h3>Galatians 3–5 — Returning to Sinai Is Regression</h3>
  <p class="ref">
    The Law functioned as a guardian until Christ. Now that faith has come, believers are no longer under that guardian.
    Paul treats Law-return as a move away from Christ, not a deeper maturity in Christ
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal3-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 3–5</a>).
  </p>

  <h3>Hebrews 8:13 — Obsolete and Ready to Vanish</h3>
  <p class="ref">
    Hebrews states that by calling the covenant “new,” the first becomes obsolete, aging, and “near vanishing”
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Heb8.13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 8:13</a>).
    This fits the first-century covenant transition, culminating in AD 70 with the definitive removal of the old covenant world’s center (the temple)
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Matt24.1-34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 24:1–34</a>).
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Where Covenant Theology and Theonomy Go Wrong</h2>

  <h3>1) “Moral / Ceremonial / Civil” is not the Bible’s division</h3>
  <p>
    Scripture presents the Law as a unified covenant package. Breaking one point makes you guilty of the whole
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Jas2.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James 2:10</a>).
    The popular tripartite division is a later theological grid used to keep parts of Sinai alive while discarding the rest.
  </p>

  <h3>2) “Law as the Christian rule of life” quietly reinstalls Sinai</h3>
  <p>
    When the Mosaic code becomes the baseline for Christian life, the gospel is reduced to “forgiveness so you can go back to law.”
    Paul’s direction is the opposite: the Spirit produces the fruit the Law could never produce by command
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom8.1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8:1–4</a>;
    <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.22-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:22–23</a>).
  </p>

  <h3>3) Theonomy turns Sinai into a political program</h3>
  <p>
    Theonomy argues that Mosaic civil law should govern modern nations. That is a category error.
    Sinai was a covenant charter for Israel under a temple-centered administration. It was not issued to the nations,
    and it is not the constitution of the New Creation
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.John18.36" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 18:36</a>;
    <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Heb12.18-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 12:18–24</a>).
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <b>Bottom line:</b>
    covenant theology often keeps Sinai as the measuring stick; theonomy tries to enforce it.
    Both moves pull people backwards into the covenant Christ fulfilled and closed
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:1–4</a>).
  </div>

  <hr />

  <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
  <p>
    In Christ, righteousness is not a demand hanging over you from Sinai. It is a gift and a shared life.
    The New Covenant doesn’t place believers at the foot of a mountain of commands; it seats them in union with the Son
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Eph2.4-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ephesians 2:4–6</a>).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>You are not under the Law.</b> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:14</a>)</li>
    <li><b>You are led by the Spirit.</b> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:18</a>)</li>
    <li><b>You are complete in Christ.</b> (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:10</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Where have you been tempted to measure your standing with God by Sinai-based categories?</li>
    <li>What changes when you treat holiness as Spirit-produced fruit rather than law-driven pressure?</li>
    <li>Do your “shoulds” come from Christ’s finished work—or from a quiet return to Moses?</li>
  </ul>
