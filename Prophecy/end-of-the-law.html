<h1>The End of the Law — Covenant Jurisdiction After Christ</h1>

<p class="small">
  This page is written to settle one foundational question that controls how the entire Bible is read:
  <b>Are believers in Christ still under the jurisdiction of the Mosaic Law?</b>
  The FP Bible answer is direct and non-negotiable: <b>No.</b>
</p>

<p>
  “Not under law” does not mean “less serious faith,” “lower standards,” or “moral chaos.”
  It means a <b>change of covenant world</b>, a <b>change of legal authority</b>, and a <b>change of how life with God operates</b>.
</p>

<div class="note">
  Many theological systems say the Law is “fulfilled” but still functionally governing.
  Scripture says something stronger: the Law’s covenant authority has ended.
  If Sinai still rules, then Christ did not actually introduce a new covenant order.
</div>

<hr />

<div class="key">
  <h2>Core Thesis</h2>
  <p>
    The Mosaic Law was a <b>temporary covenant administration</b> given to Israel,
    tied to temple, priesthood, sacrifice, land, and national identity.
    It was never presented as an eternal moral constitution for humanity.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Christ, that covenant reached its intended conclusion:
    the Law’s legal claims were removed
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:14</a>),
    its jurisdiction ended through covenant death
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom7.1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 7:1–6</a>),
    and believers now live under the administration of the Spirit
    (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.2Co3.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>).
  </p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>What “Not Under Law” Actually Means</h2>

<h3>1) Jurisdiction Has Changed</h3>
<p>
  Paul’s statement “you are not under law but under grace”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:14</a>)
  is not a slogan. It is a covenant-legal declaration.
  Law has authority only within its covenant domain. When that covenant ends, its authority ends with it.
</p>
<p>
  Paul argues this explicitly using legal logic:
  law rules only while the covenant subject lives, but through union with Christ’s death believers have become
  “dead to the law” to belong to Another
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom7.1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 7:1–6</a>).
</p>

<h3>2) Condemnation Has Ended</h3>
<p>
  The Law’s power was not transformation. Its power was prosecution, exposure, and condemnation.
  Paul calls it “the ministry of death” and “the ministry of condemnation”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.2Co3.7-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 3:7–9</a>).
</p>
<p>
  In Christ, that prosecuting authority is removed:
  “no condemnation”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom8.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8:1</a>).
</p>

<h3>3) Identity Is No Longer Sinai-Based</h3>
<p>
  Under the Law, identity was defined by boundary markers (circumcision, food laws, calendar observance, temple access).
  In Christ, identity is defined by union, not regulation. Jew and Gentile are formed into one new humanity
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Eph2.11-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ephesians 2:11–22</a>).
</p>
<p>
  To return to Law-based identity is to rebuild what Christ tore down. That is not “depth.” It is regression.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Walking by the Spirit Is Walking in Love</h2>

<p>
  Paul’s contrast between <b>Law</b> and <b>Spirit</b> is not obedience vs disobedience.
  It is external covenant enforcement vs internal covenant life.
</p>

<p>
  “Walk by the Spirit” is not vague spirituality. Paul defines it:
  the fruit of the Spirit is love
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:22</a>).
  Love is the governing reality from which the rest flows.
</p>

<p>
  This is why Paul can say:
  “He who loves another has fulfilled the Law”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom13.8-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 13:8–10</a>),
  and “all the Law is fulfilled in one word: you shall love your neighbor as yourself”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:14</a>).
</p>

<div class="note">
  Love does not <i>revive</i> Sinai. Love <i>fulfills</i> Sinai — meaning the Law’s intended outcome is reached,
  and its jurisdiction is no longer needed. The Spirit produces what the Law demanded but could never generate
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.22-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:22–23</a>).
</div>

<p>
  That is why Paul’s logic is direct:
  “If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:18</a>).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>AD 70: The Total End of the Law System</h2>

<p>
  The cross legally disarmed the Law, but the old covenant world still stood institutionally for a time.
  From AD 30–70, the New Covenant was inaugurated while the Old Covenant still existed in public form:
  temple still stood, sacrifices still occurred, priests still officiated, and Torah-identity still claimed authority.
</p>

<p>
  That overlap is why apostolic letters often sound intense. The apostles were not debating abstractions.
  They were navigating a real covenant collision.
</p>

<p>
  In AD 70 the Law system was not “reformed.” It was dismantled.
  Jerusalem fell, the temple was destroyed, sacrifice ended, priesthood ended, genealogical authority vanished,
  and the covenant enforcement center was removed.
  This was not symbolic. It was the objective, historical termination of the Mosaic administration.
</p>

<p>
  Hebrews describes the old covenant as obsolete and “near vanishing”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Heb8.13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 8:13</a>),
  consistent with Jesus’ time-statements concerning that generation and the temple’s end
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Matt24.1-34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 24:1–34</a>).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Apostolic Battle: New Creation vs Return to Sinai</h2>

<p>
  Much of the New Testament records a battle: will the church be defined by <b>Christ</b> or by <b>Sinai</b>?
  That conflict dominates Galatians, Romans, Hebrews, Acts, and parts of Corinthians.
</p>

<p>
  The key point is this: the apostolic conflict was <b>transitional</b>, not timeless.
  It was written inside the AD 30–70 overlap when the old system still stood.
</p>

<div class="note">
  Modern religion keeps replaying that battle because it reads the apostolic period as if the overlap is permanent.
  It imports transitional tension into a post-transition world. That is why “New Creation” language often gets
  paired with Sinai-shaped ethics, fears, measurements, and identity markers.
</div>

<p>
  Paul does not treat Law-return as harmless or optional. He treats it as regression:
  rebuilding the Law is falling from grace
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:1–4</a>).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What “Not Under Law” Does <em>Not</em> Mean</h2>

<h3>It Does Not Mean Moral Collapse</h3>
<p>
  Paul answers the objection directly:
  “Shall we sin because we are not under law?”
  “By no means”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:15</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Holiness under the New Covenant is not command-enforcement. It is shared life.
  The Spirit produces what the Law could never produce by pressure
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom8.1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8:1–4</a>).
</p>

<h3>It Does Not Mean God Changed</h3>
<p>
  God’s character did not change. Covenant administration did.
  The Law was a guardian until Christ; once faith has come, believers are no longer under that guardian
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal3.24-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 3:24–25</a>).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Where Covenant Theology and Theonomy Go Wrong</h2>

<h3>1) They Redefine Fulfillment to Preserve Sinai</h3>
<p>
  Covenant theology often says the Law is “fulfilled” while still functioning as the Christian rule of life.
  That is not fulfillment; it is reinstallation.
</p>

<h3>2) They Divide What Scripture Treats as One</h3>
<p>
  Scripture treats the Law as a unified covenant package. Breaking one point makes you guilty of the whole
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Jas2.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James 2:10</a>).
  The tripartite scheme (moral/civil/ceremonial) is a later theological grid used to keep Sinai alive.
</p>

<h3>3) Theonomy Turns Sinai into a Political Blueprint</h3>
<p>
  Theonomy attempts to universalize Israel’s covenant charter.
  Jesus explicitly rejects this model: His kingdom is not from this world
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.John18.36" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 18:36</a>).
</p>

<div class="note">
  Bottom line: covenant theology preserves Sinai; theonomy enforces it.
  Both misunderstand the finality of the covenant transition and the New Creation operating reality.
</div>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
  In the New Creation, righteousness is not a demand hanging over you. It is a shared life in Christ.
  You are complete in Him
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Col2.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colossians 2:10</a>),
  led by the Spirit
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:18</a>),
  and free from the Law’s jurisdiction
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 6:14</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Love is not law-lite. Love is law transcended.
  “Against such things there is no law”
  (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:23</a>)
  — not because standards were lowered, but because the Law has nothing left to prosecute where life reigns.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Where have you been tempted to measure your standing with God by Sinai-based categories?</li>
  <li>What changes when holiness is treated as Spirit-produced fruit rather than law-driven pressure?</li>
  <li>Are your “shoulds” flowing from union with Christ, or from a quiet return to Moses?</li>
</ul>
