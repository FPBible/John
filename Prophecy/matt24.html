<h1>Matthew 24</h1>
<h2>The End of the Age · Covenant Judgment · “Coming on the Clouds”</h2>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Reading Frame (Mandatory)</strong><br />
  Matthew 24 is not a prediction of the end of the physical universe.
  It is Jesus’ covenant judgment discourse concerning the end of the Old Covenant age,
  centred on the Temple and Jerusalem.
  The controlling time marker is: <span class="key">“this generation.”</span>
  “Coming,” “clouds,” “day,” and cosmic imagery belong to Old Testament covenant-judgment language,
  not modern futurist expectation.
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Temple destruction is the catalyst for the discourse</li>
  <li>The disciples’ questions are covenantal, not cosmic</li>
  <li>Tribulation and signs are local and historical</li>
  <li>“Coming on the clouds” announces royal judgment</li>
  <li>Fulfilment is bounded by “this generation”</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>1) Context: Why the Temple matters</h2>

<p>
Jesus departs from the Temple and announces its destruction.
For first-century Jews, the Temple was not merely religious architecture —
it was the centre of covenant life.
Jesus’ words are explicit:
“Not one stone here will be left on another.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:1–2)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Fulfilled Lens</strong><br />
  If the Temple falls, the covenant world structured around it collapses.
  Matthew 24 therefore concerns the end of a covenant age,
  not the end of the planet.
</div>

<h2>2) The disciples’ questions</h2>

<p>
They ask two related questions:
“When will these things be?”
and
“What will be the sign of your presence and the end of the age?”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:3)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Key Point</strong><br />
  The questions arise directly from Jesus’ statement about the Temple.
  The “end of the age” refers to the end of the Temple-centred covenant order.
</div>

<h2>3) Wars, famines, persecution — “not yet”</h2>

<p>
Jesus lists wars, famines, earthquakes, and unrest,
then warns: “The end is not yet.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:4–8)</a>
</p>

<p>
These are not the sign itself,
but background turbulence preceding the covenant climax.
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Clarification — “Not yet”</strong><br />
  “Not yet” does not shift fulfilment thousands of years forward.
  It prevents mistaking general unrest for the specific covenant judgment Jesus is describing.
</div>

<h2>4) The Abomination and the flight from Judea</h2>

<p>
“When you see the abomination of desolation…
then let those in Judea flee to the mountains.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:15–16)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Geographic Constraint</strong><br />
  This instruction is limited to Judea.
  A global end-of-the-world reading collapses under Jesus’ own geography.
</div>

<h2>5) “Great tribulation”</h2>

<p>
Jesus speaks of “great tribulation”
unequalled in Israel’s history.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:21–22)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Clarification</strong><br />
  Prophetic language describes covenant catastrophe,
  not universal extinction.
  The scope remains Jerusalem and its people.
</div>

<h2>6) Sun, moon, and stars</h2>

<p>
“The sun will be darkened… the stars will fall.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:29)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Covenantal Imagery</strong><br />
  This language consistently symbolises the collapse of governing powers and covenant order
  throughout the Old Testament.
  It is not astronomical prediction.
</div>

<h2>7) “Coming on the clouds”</h2>

<p>
“They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:30)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Royal Judgment Language</strong><br />
  Cloud-coming imagery announces divine authority and judgment.
  Jesus applies this language to His covenant verdict on the old order,
  publicly manifested in Jerusalem’s fall.
</div>

<p>
“He will gather His elect.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:31)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Gathering Explained</strong><br />
  This is covenant regathering,
  not physical evacuation —
  the people of God consolidated into Messiah-centred life
  as old boundaries collapse.
</div>

<h2>8) “This generation”</h2>

<p>
“Truly I say to you,
this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:34)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Non-Negotiable Time Marker</strong><br />
  Jesus said <em>all</em> these things.
  Any interpretation that postpones fulfilment beyond that generation
  contradicts the text’s explicit boundary.
</div>

<p>
“Heaven and earth will pass away,
but my words will not.”
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:35)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Heaven and Earth</strong><br />
  In covenantal language,
  “heaven and earth” can describe a religious world order.
  Jesus contrasts the permanence of His word
  with the passing of the old covenant structure.
</div>

<h2>9) Watchfulness</h2>

<p>
Jesus calls His disciples to alert faithfulness,
not date-setting.
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm">(Matt 24:36–51)</a>
</p>

<div class="frame">
  <strong>Clarification</strong><br />
  Not knowing the exact day does not negate the stated time-frame.
  Watchfulness makes sense precisely because the event was near to them.
</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>

  <li>“Coming” language expresses royal judgment</li>
  <li>Fulfilment is bounded by “this generation”</li>
  <li>The New Creation emerges as the old order collapses</li>
