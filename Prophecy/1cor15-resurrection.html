<h1>1 Corinthians 15</h1>
<h2>Resurrection Fulfilled — Covenant Death Ended, New Creation Life Established</h2>

<p class="note">
Primary text:

1 Corinthians 15 — WEB
</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why 1 Corinthians 15 Matters</h2>

<p>
1 Corinthians 15 is often treated as a future-oriented chapter about the end of the world,
the resurrection of physical corpses,
and a final event still awaiting fulfilment.
That reading does not arise from the text itself —
it is imposed on the text by later theological assumptions.
</p>

<p>
Paul is not speculating about a distant horizon.
He is addressing a real first-century problem:
some in Corinth are denying resurrection,
which in Paul’s covenant framework
means denying the transition from death under the Law
to life in the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
This chapter explains how resurrection has already occurred,
how it was foretold in Israel’s Scriptures,
and how it defines the present New Creation reality.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Resurrection as Covenant Transition</h2>

<p>
In the Hebrew Scriptures,
resurrection language overwhelmingly refers to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>restoration from covenant death</li>
  <li>return from exile</li>
  <li>renewal of Israel’s identity</li>
  <li>movement from judgment into life</li>
</ul>

<p>
Key prophetic texts include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ezekiel 37</strong> — dry bones restored as Israel</li>
  <li><strong>Isaiah 26</strong> — the dead rising as covenant vindication</li>
  <li><strong>Daniel 12</strong> — awakening from covenant shame</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paul stands firmly inside this prophetic tradition.
Resurrection is not escape from the world;
it is transformation of a people.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>“The End of the Ages Has Come” (1 Cor 10:11)</h2>

<p>
Paul has already stated explicitly that
the end of the ages had arrived upon his generation.
1 Corinthians 15 must be read inside that framework.
</p>

<p>
Resurrection belongs to the same covenant moment as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end of the Law’s authority</li>
  <li>the defeat of sin as covenant power</li>
  <li>the collapse of temple-mediated identity</li>
</ul>

<p>
To postpone resurrection
is to contradict Paul’s own time markers.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Adam and Christ: Two Covenant Realms</h2>

<blockquote>
“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all are being made alive.” (1 Cor 15:22)
</blockquote>

<p>
Adam and Christ are not merely biological representatives.
They are covenant heads.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Adam</strong> represents humanity under Law, sin, and death</li>
  <li><strong>Christ</strong> represents humanity in Spirit, righteousness, and life</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paul’s contrast is about realms of existence,
not timelines for corpses.
</p>

<p>
To be “in Christ” is already to participate in resurrection life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>“At His Presence” (Parousia)</h2>

<p>
Paul states that those belonging to Christ are made alive
“at His presence” (parousia).
</p>

<p>
Parousia does not mean physical descent through the sky.
It means royal presence, revealed authority, and covenant vindication.
</p>

<p>
Jesus Himself defined this presence as occurring
within the lifetime of His generation.
Paul is not contradicting Jesus —
he is explaining the meaning of that presence.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>“Then Comes the End” — What End?</h2>

<blockquote>
“Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father.” (1 Cor 15:24)
</blockquote>

<p>
Paul defines “the end” precisely:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>abolition of hostile powers</li>
  <li>defeat of death</li>
  <li>completion of Christ’s reign</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not the end of history.
It is the end of the old covenant world.
</p>

<p>
The Law empowered sin.
The Law gave death its sting.
When the Law’s authority ended,
death lost its power.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>“Flesh and Blood Cannot Inherit the Kingdom”</h2>

<p>
This phrase is not anti-material.
It is covenantal.
</p>

<p>
“Flesh and blood” describes humanity defined by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>mortal identity</li>
  <li>Law-based righteousness</li>
  <li>earthly covenant markers</li>
</ul>

<p>
The kingdom is inherited through Spirit,
not Torah,
not lineage,
not temple.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Last Trumpet</h2>

<p>
Trumpet imagery in Scripture consistently signals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>covenant announcements</li>
  <li>judgment warnings</li>
  <li>transition moments</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paul is not importing Roman battlefield imagery.
He is drawing from prophetic language
familiar to Jewish hearers.
</p>

<p>
The “last trumpet” marks the completion
of covenant change,
not the destruction of the cosmos.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>“Death Has Been Swallowed Up in Victory”</h2>

<p>
Paul does not say death <em>will be</em> swallowed up.
He says it <em>has been</em>.
</p>

<p>
Victory is not pending.
It is accomplished.
</p>

<p>
Believers do not wait for resurrection.
They live from it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why This Matters Today</h2>

<p>
If resurrection is postponed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Creation life is delayed</li>
  <li>death retains authority</li>
  <li>hope is displaced into the future</li>
</ul>

<p>
If resurrection is fulfilled:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>life defines the present</li>
  <li>fear loses leverage</li>
  <li>identity is anchored in Christ</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paul’s conclusion makes sense only if resurrection is real now:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Therefore… be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.”
</blockquote>

<p>
You don’t build your life on something that hasn’t happened yet.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>1 Corinthians 15 is covenantal, not futuristic</li>
  <li>Resurrection is fulfilled, not postponed</li>
  <li>Death’s authority has ended</li>
  <li>New Creation life defines the present world</li>
</ul>

<p>
This chapter is not about waiting for life.
It is about recognising where life already reigns.
