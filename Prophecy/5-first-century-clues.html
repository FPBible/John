<h1>5 First-Century Clues the “Second Coming” Already Happened</h1>
<h2>Time statements · Hebrew idiom · Covenant transition (AD 30–70)</h2>

<p class="note">
This is not end-times theatre. It’s a context check.
If Jesus and the apostles spoke in a first-century horizon, we should read them that way.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>
Most modern “end-times” thinking assumes the New Testament points to a far future collapse of the physical world.
But the New Testament writers were not writing to people 2,000 years away.
They wrote to real churches in pressure, using prophetic language that already had rules.
</p>

<p>
Preterism argues that the bulk of New Testament “coming” / “day” / “wrath” language is covenant-judgment vocabulary
fulfilled in the first-century transition — climaxing in the fall of Jerusalem and the temple (AD 70).
That event ended the old covenant public order and confirmed the new covenant reality already established in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) Jesus put the fulfilment in <em>their</em> generation</h2>
<p>
The most direct clue is Jesus’ own time-frame. He repeatedly locates the decisive “coming in the kingdom”
within the lifetime of his contemporaries.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Matthew 16:28</strong> — “some standing here” would see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT16.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Matthew 24:34</strong> — “this generation” would not pass until “all these things” were fulfilled
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
In the Gospels, “this generation” is consistently the present generation Jesus is confronting — especially the covenant leadership.
If we push it thousands of years forward, we aren’t following the text; we’re overriding it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) “End of the world” is usually “end of the age”</h2>
<p>
A major source of confusion is translation habit. In key places the question is not “end of the planet”
but “end of the age” — the closing of a covenant era.
</p>

<p>
In Matthew 24 the disciples ask about the destruction of the temple and the completion of the age
(<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT24.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>).
That question fits a Jewish covenant horizon: temple, sacrifice, priesthood, and national judgement.
AD 70 marks the public end of that world-order.
</p>

<p class="note">
FPBible rule: if “world-ending” language is assumed without covenant context, interpretation drifts fast.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Apocalyptic cosmic language is prophetic imagery, not astronomy</h2>
<p>
Jesus’ “sun darkened / stars falling” language belongs to the Old Testament prophetic pattern:
cosmic-collapse imagery used to describe national judgement and regime change.
The prophets did this repeatedly.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Isaiah 13</strong> — cosmic language used for Babylon’s fall
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA13.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Isaiah 34</strong> — “heavens rolled up” language used for judgement on Edom
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ISA34.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Nobody reads those as literal starfall. The imagery communicates the scale of judgement:
a world ending — but a covenant world, a political-religious order, a public system.
That’s exactly how Jesus uses it in the temple-judgement context.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) The apostles speak with “near / at hand / about to” urgency</h2>
<p>
The early Christian writings are full of nearness language.
That isn’t hype; it’s consistent with Jesus’ “this generation” time-frame.
</p>

<h3>Paul</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1 Corinthians 7:29</strong> — “the time is short” (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO07.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>1 Corinthians 10:11</strong> — “the ends of the ages have come” (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1CO10.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Philippians 4:5</strong> — “The Lord is at hand” (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/PHP04.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Romans 13:11–12</strong> — “the day is at hand” (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/ROM13.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>James</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>James 5:8–9</strong> — “the coming of the Lord is near… the Judge is standing at the door”
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/JAS05.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Peter</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1 Peter 4:7</strong> — “the end of all things is at hand”
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/1PE04.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If all this urgency is pushed into our future, you’re left with a blunt problem:
the apostles repeatedly speak as if something is imminent — and then it never arrives.
The first-century fulfilment reading removes that contradiction.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) Revelation frames itself as “soon / near” to its audience</h2>
<p>
Revelation opens and closes with time statements that control interpretation:
the message concerns things that would happen soon, and the time is near.
That matters because the book was written to real first-century churches.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Revelation 1:1–3</strong> — “must happen soon… the time is near”
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV01.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
  <li><strong>Revelation 22:10</strong> — “Do not seal… the time is near”
    (<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/REV22.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEB</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Revelation is apocalyptic: beasts, cities, numbers, and cosmic imagery.
The default method is: OT prophetic pattern → first-century setting → covenant meaning.
That is why FPBible reads Revelation as symbolic judgement on the old covenant world-order and vindication of the faithful,
not as a modern newspaper codebook.
</p>

<p class="note">
For a fuller Revelation framework, see:
<a href="/Bible/Prophecy/revelation.html">Revelation — Symbol, Judgement, Victory</a>
and the Revelation book appendix:
<a href="/Bible/Revelation/appendix.html">Revelation Appendix</a>.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Taken together, the clues converge:
Jesus sets a first-century time-frame, the apostles write with “at hand” urgency,
apocalyptic language follows the prophetic idiom, and Revelation locks itself to “near” fulfilment.
That points to AD 70 as the covenant climax — not a delayed promise.
</p>

<p>
If the “coming” was fulfilled as covenant judgement and vindication, the question shifts:
not “what are we waiting for?” but “what are we living from?”
New Creation faith is not delay theology — it is present participation in Christ’s finished reign.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
If the King is not awaited but present, where am I still living from delay —
fear, performance, control, religious striving, or constant “later” thinking?
