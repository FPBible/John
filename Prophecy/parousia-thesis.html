<h1>An Examination of the Preterist Thesis</h1>
<h2>The Parousia as Fulfilled Prophecy in AD 70</h2>

<p class="note">
Purpose: a single, reusable framework page for “coming / day / wrath / end / resurrection / new heavens &amp; earth” language.
Chapters should link here instead of repeating long explanations.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This study outlines the Preterist thesis that the <em>Parousia</em> (Christ’s “coming” in judgment) and its associated prophetic
events were fulfilled in the first century, reaching a decisive climax in the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple in AD 70.
The goal here is not to run debates, but to set out the interpretive controls that make the New Testament’s time-statements,
prophetic idioms, and apocalyptic imagery readable in their original covenant horizon.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) Introduction: defining the framework</h2>
<p>
Preterism reads New Testament “end” language as covenantal, not cosmic. The argument is simple:
the apostles and early churches were not writing a timeline for distant centuries; they were speaking into a live covenant crisis
that was nearing its historical conclusion.
</p>

<p>
This framework treats AD 70 as the public end of the temple-world (Mosaic age) and the open manifestation of the New Covenant reality:
Christ enthroned, access secured, and the old world judged and removed as a binding authority.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) Method: what controls interpretation</h2>

<h3>2.1 Time-texts are not decoration</h3>
<p>
Preterism takes New Testament nearness language seriously: “near”, “at hand”, “soon”, “about to”, “quickly”.
If those terms are stretched into meaninglessness, the text becomes impossible to read consistently.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>“Near / at hand”</strong> — not “sometime in the next few thousand years”</li>
  <li><strong>“About to”</strong> (mellō) — a real horizon for the original audience</li>
  <li><strong>“Soon / quickly”</strong> — a genuine timeframe in their lived world</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Apocalyptic imagery is prophetic idiom</h3>
<p>
Cosmic-collapse language (sun darkened, stars falling, heavens shaken) is standard prophetic vocabulary for covenant upheaval,
regime change, and judgment on a nation. The Old Testament uses the same imagery for historical judgments (e.g., Babylon, Edom).
That’s the interpretive precedent.
</p>

<p class="note">
Rule: interpret imagery by OT patterns first, then apply it to the first-century crisis the NT writers addressed.
Do not turn prophetic poetry into astronomy forecasts.
</p>

<h3>2.3 No double-fulfilment schemes</h3>
<p>
This project rejects “double fulfilment” and “gap insertion” methods that detach the text from its audience and turn it into
a moving target. If the text sets a time-horizon, that horizon governs the reading.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Prophetic prelude: Malachi to John the Baptist</h2>
<p>
The closing prophets frame a coming “day” of covenant reckoning, and John the Baptist arrives announcing judgement language
in the same prophetic register (fire, axe to the root, chaff and wheat). This is not random moralising;
it is covenant lawsuit vocabulary aimed at a corrupt order that is about to be weighed and removed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Jesus’ teaching: “this generation” and the end of the age</h2>

<h3>4.1 “This generation” means His contemporaries</h3>
<p>
In the Gospels, “this generation” is consistently used as a near-term reference to the people Jesus addressed in that moment.
Preterism treats that as the plain sense unless the context forces another meaning (and it does not).
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Matthew 24:34</strong> — “This generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.”</li>
  <li><strong>Matthew 16:28</strong> — “Some standing here… will not taste death until they see…”</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 “End of the age” is covenant-age language</h3>
<p>
The “age” is not the planet. It is the covenant world-order. “End of the age” points to the terminal phase of the Mosaic system
and its temple-centred administration — the very world Hebrews calls “obsolete” and “ready to vanish”.
</p>

<h3>4.3 “Immediately… then…” forbids millennia gaps</h3>
<p>
Preterism argues that the Olivet Discourse does not allow a multi-millennial insertion between tribulation language and coming/judgement language.
The text uses tight connectors (“immediately”, “then”) to keep the discourse anchored to that horizon.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) Apostolic expectation: the event was “near” for them</h2>
<p>
Across the epistles, the churches are addressed as people standing in the closing phase of an age:
the day is near, judgement is approaching, and the “coming” is treated as impending.
That doesn’t read like vague religious motivation; it reads like covenant crisis timing.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Paul</strong> — “the time is short”, “the Lord is near”, “the ends of the ages have come”</li>
  <li><strong>James</strong> — “the coming of the Lord has drawn near… the Judge stands at the door”</li>
  <li><strong>Peter</strong> — “the end of all things is near… judgement begins at the house of God”</li>
  <li><strong>Hebrews</strong> — “in a very little while… will not delay”</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>6) Revelation: apocalyptic judgement in its own timeframe</h2>
<p>
Revelation frames itself with nearness statements (“soon”, “near”, “do not seal”). Preterism reads the book as
symbolic prophecy concerning first-century conflict, covenant judgement, and vindication — not as a modern newspaper code.
</p>

<p class="note">
For Revelation-specific symbols (Babylon, Beast/Mark, millennium, lake of fire, New Jerusalem),
use the Revelation Appendix so chapter pages stay readable.

  <li><a href="/Bible/Revelation/appendix.html">Revelation Appendix (Book folder)</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>7) Implications: resurrection language and creeds</h2>
<p>
A fulfilled-horizon reading forces clarity on “resurrection” vocabulary, covenant membership language, and the relationship between
Scripture and later creedal formulations.
FPBible’s control is Scripture-first: creeds are historical documents, not interpretive masters.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/Bible/Prophecy/resurrection/1cor15.html">1 Corinthians 15 — Resurrection and Victory</a></li>
  <li><a href="/Bible/Prophecy/new-creation.html">New Creation — Living From What’s Finished</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Preterism stands or falls on its interpretive controls: audience relevance, literal time-texts, and symbolic prophetic idiom.
When those controls are honoured, the New Testament’s “coming / day / end / judgement” language reads as a coherent first-century
covenant transition — not a perpetual delay.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
If “the end” was the end of an age — not the end of reality — what religious fear have I been carrying that the apostles were never trying to create?
