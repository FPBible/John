  <section class="card" id="commentary">
    <h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase Commentary (Deep)</h2>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>1) This chapter is pressure + vindication, not prediction</h3>
      <p>
        Paul is not addressing abstract theology or distant prophecy. He is writing into active persecution already being experienced by the Thessalonian believers.
        This chapter is framed by present suffering and imminent vindication, not speculation about the end of history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything Paul says is anchored to the lived reality of first-century believers facing hostility from covenantal and civic powers aligned against the gospel.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>2) “Righteous judgment of God” is covenant justice in their horizon</h3>
      <p>
        God’s judgment here is not general and not timeless. It is covenantal and situational. The persecution of the Thessalonians is evidence that a decisive intervention is approaching —
        one that will publicly demonstrate where covenant loyalty truly lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judgment is “righteous” because it is measured, deserved, and historically appropriate. It does not fall on “the world” indiscriminately. It falls on those actively opposing the gospel
        and afflicting Christ’s people.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>3) “Counted worthy of the Kingdom” is vindication, not merit</h3>
      <p>
        This is not moral earning and not future qualification. To be “counted worthy” is courtroom language: vindicated as belonging to the Kingdom that was already being established in their generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their suffering does not delay the Kingdom; it confirms their participation in it. The Kingdom is present in Christ’s reign and is shown to be present when persecutors are judged and the saints are relieved.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>4) “Affliction to those who afflict you” is covenant reversal</h3>
      <p>
        This is not personal revenge. It is historical recompense: the persecuting system will be judged, dismantled, and removed. Paul is announcing covenant justice within the first-century conflict,
        not a timeless threat directed at everyone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>5) “Relief” is not escape from earth — it is removal of the pressure-source</h3>
      <p>
        Relief is release from persecution through the removal of its source. Paul is not promising evacuation; he expects continuity of life. That only fits if the opposing power is about to be broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        This matches the prophets: God “delivers” by judging, not by deleting the world.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>6) “Revealed from heaven” is authority unveiled, not a sky-travel scene</h3>
      <p>
        “Heaven” here refers to divine authority, not a physical location above the clouds. To be “revealed from heaven” means Christ’s royal authority is made unmistakably visible through judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is Old Testament idiom: God is said to “come” or be “revealed” through historical acts of judgment against nations and covenant violators. No physical descent is implied or required.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>7) “Flaming fire” is covenant judgment imagery</h3>
      <p>
        Fire is a biblical symbol of judgment, purification, and covenant removal. It is not literal flame engulfing the globe. It is the destructive force of divine judgment consuming a corrupt order.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>8) “Those who don’t know God” is covenant language</h3>
      <p>
        “Knowing God” is covenantal, not intellectual. To “not know God” is to reject His revealed will and His gospel. Paul is indicting covenant unfaithfulness, not global ignorance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>9) “Eternal destruction” is irreversible covenant removal</h3>
      <p>
        “Eternal” (aiōnios) describes the nature of the outcome — irreversible and decisive — not endless torment. What is destroyed is a covenant standing and a corrupt order that does not return.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>10) “Glorified in His saints” is vindication on the ground</h3>
      <p>
        Christ is glorified when His people are publicly vindicated and His authority is confirmed through judgment on their persecutors.
        The saints are not spectators of glory; they are the means by which that glory is displayed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>11) Summary: what this chapter is doing</h3>
      <p>
        2 Thessalonians 1 is not apocalyptic forecasting. It is a declaration of imminent covenant justice, reassurance to persecuted believers,
        a warning to those resisting the gospel, and confirmation that Christ’s reign is actively asserting itself in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in this chapter points beyond the first-century transition period. Nothing awaits a second fulfillment.
