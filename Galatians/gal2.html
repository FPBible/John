<h1>Galatians 2</h1>
<h2>Justified in Christ · No Return to the Law</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase (Galatians 2)</h2>

<p><strong>2:1–5</strong> After fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. I went because of a revelation and laid before them the gospel I proclaim among the nations. I did this privately with those considered influential, so that my work would not be undermined. Yet not even Titus, who was with me and is Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. This issue arose because false brothers slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back into slavery. We did not yield to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.</p>

<p><strong>2:6–10</strong> From those who were regarded as important—whatever they once were makes no difference to me, because God shows no partiality—those leaders added nothing to my message. On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised. The same God who worked through Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised worked also through me to the nations. When James, Cephas, and John recognized the grace given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, agreeing that we should go to the nations and they to the circumcised. They asked only that we remember the poor, which I was eager to do.</p>

<p><strong>2:11–14</strong> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews joined in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away. When I saw that they were not walking in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</p>

<p><strong>2:15–21</strong> We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners, yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by Christ’s faithfulness and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified. If, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ a servant of sin? Absolutely not. If I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself a transgressor. For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live—but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh I live by the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God. If righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>
<p>
Paul recounts two decisive confrontations: one in Jerusalem and one in Antioch.
Both expose the same issue — whether Gentile believers must conform to Jewish law
in order to belong at the table. Paul treats this not as a cultural disagreement,
but as a direct threat to the truth of the gospel itself.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Covenant / New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) Titus settles the issue before it begins</h3>
<p>
Titus is the test case. A Spirit-filled Gentile believer stands before the apostles
and is not compelled to be circumcised. This is not accidental.
It is a covenant verdict: Gentiles belong without becoming Jews.
Anything else would deny the sufficiency of Christ.
</p>

<h3>2) “False brothers” want to reverse freedom</h3>
<p>
Paul is blunt. These are not sincere seekers.
They are attempting to reintroduce slavery by reasserting law-based control.
Their concern is not holiness, but boundary enforcement.
Paul refuses compromise because compromise here destroys freedom.
</p>

<h3>3) Leadership status does not override gospel truth</h3>
<p>
Paul does not appeal to hierarchy.
He appeals to grace.
Even respected leaders “added nothing” to the gospel.
Authority in the New Covenant does not come from position,
but from alignment with what Christ has accomplished.
</p>

<h3>4) The Antioch incident exposes covenant hypocrisy</h3>
<p>
Peter’s withdrawal is not about manners.
It is a lived denial of the gospel.
Table fellowship declares covenant reality.
To withdraw is to imply Gentiles are second-class unless they adopt Jewish markers.
Paul confronts this publicly because the distortion was public.
</p>

<h3>5) Justification by Christ’s faithfulness ends law-righteousness</h3>
<p>
Paul’s conclusion is definitive.
Justification does not come from law observance,
but from the faithfulness of Jesus the Messiah.
To rebuild law as a basis of righteousness
is to deny the cross and empty grace of meaning.
</p>

<h3>6) “I died to the law” is not metaphorical</h3>
<p>
Paul does not say the law improved him.
He says it killed him.
Through the law’s own verdict,
he died to it as a covenant authority.
Life now flows from union with Christ,
not compliance with a system that has ended.

<h2>Key Idioms & Language Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Works of the law”</strong> — Covenant boundary markers, not generic good deeds.</li>
  <li><strong>“Justified”</strong> — Declared right within a covenant, not morally upgraded.</li>
  <li><strong>“Crucified with Christ”</strong> — Participation in the end of the old identity system.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Galatians 2 removes every excuse for hierarchy in Christ.
There are no inner circles, no upgraded classes,
no righteousness ladders.
If Christ lives in you, you belong fully.
Any system that pressures conformity beyond Christ
is a return to slavery — no matter how spiritual it sounds.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be withdrawing from full fellowship
because of fear, tradition, or approval?
