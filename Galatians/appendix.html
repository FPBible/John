<h1>Galatians — Appendix</h1>
<h2>Key Themes, Terms, and Covenant Framework</h2>

<p>
This appendix provides orientation for reading Galatians clearly.
It is not a running commentary.
It highlights the covenant framework, key terms,
and recurring contrasts that govern Paul’s argument.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) Law as Covenant System</h2>

<p>
In Galatians, “law” does not mean generic moral instruction.
It refers to the Mosaic covenant as a governing system —
including circumcision, calendar observance, boundary markers,
and the legal framework that defined Israel’s identity.
</p>

<p>
Paul’s argument is not that the law was bad,
but that its role was temporary.
Once Christ has come,
the law no longer functions as a covenant authority.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) Promise Versus Law</h2>

<p>
Paul contrasts promise and law,
not as two spiritual techniques,
but as two covenant foundations.
</p>

<p>
Promise precedes law,
and promise is fulfilled in Christ.
Law cannot inherit;
only promise does.
</p>

<p>
This is why returning to the law is not spiritual caution —
it is covenant reversal.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) Curse Language</h2>

<p>
Galatians uses “curse” language drawn from Deuteronomy.
This is covenant language,
not mystical doom.
</p>

<p>
To be “under a curse” is to be under a covenant that condemns
when its terms are violated.
Christ redeems from this curse
by ending the covenant that generated it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) Seed and Inheritance</h2>

<p>
Paul’s use of “seed” (singular)
is not wordplay for its own sake.
It is a covenant argument.
</p>

<p>
Inheritance is not transmitted through ethnicity or law-keeping,
but through union with the promised Seed — Christ.
Those in Christ share the inheritance,
regardless of ethnic or legal status.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5) Slave and Son</h2>

<p>
Galatians contrasts slavery and sonship.
This is not psychological language.
It is covenant status.
</p>

<p>
The slave operates under obligation.
The son operates from belonging.
To return to the law is to return to slavery,
even if it feels religious.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6) Flesh and Spirit</h2>

<p>
“Flesh” in Galatians is not simply bodily weakness.
It refers to life oriented around the old covenant order —
self-effort, boundary maintenance, and identity derived from law.
</p>

<p>
“Spirit” refers to life animated by the New Covenant —
direct relationship, inward transformation,
and shared life in Christ.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>7) Freedom in Galatians</h2>

<p>
Freedom is not autonomy.
It is release from a system that cannot give life.
</p>

<p>
Galatians insists that freedom is the normal state
of those in Christ.
To submit again to the law
is to misunderstand what freedom is.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8) New Creation</h2>

<p>
Galatians reaches its conclusion in a single verdict:
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything.
What counts is new creation.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
New Creation is not a future hope here.
It is the present covenant reality
that replaces all former identity markers.
</p>

<h2>How to Use This Appendix</h2>

<p>
If Galatians feels confrontational,
that is intentional.
Paul is defending the integrity of the gospel.
</p>

<p>
Use this appendix to keep categories clear:
law vs promise,
slave vs son,
flesh vs Spirit,
old covenant vs New Creation.
</p>

<p>
When those lines stay clear,
Galatians reads not as harsh,
but as liberating.
