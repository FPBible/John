<h1>Galatians — Preface</h1>
<h2>Why This Letter Matters</h2>

<p>
Galatians is written in crisis.
Paul is not clarifying a minor disagreement;
he is confronting what he calls a “different gospel.”
</p>

<p>
The issue is not immorality.
It is covenant confusion.
Believers who began in Christ are being pressured
to return to the law as a means of identity and righteousness.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1) Galatians Is About Covenant, Not Behaviour</h2>

<p>
Paul’s argument is not about improving conduct through rules.
It is about which covenant defines life.
To return to the law is not maturity —
it is regression.
</p>

<p>
Galatians insists that Christ does not supplement the law.
He replaces it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2) The Law Has a Defined End</h2>

<p>
The law is described as a guardian,
a tutor,
and a temporary custodian.
It had a purpose,
and that purpose has been fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
To rebuild what has ended
is to deny what Christ has accomplished.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3) New Creation Is the Verdict</h2>

<p>
Galatians does not leave the issue abstract.
Paul states the conclusion plainly:
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything.
What counts is new creation.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
This is not poetic encouragement.
It is a covenant verdict.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4) The Spirit Replaces the Law</h2>

<p>
Life in Galatians is not managed by Torah.
It is animated by the Spirit.
The Spirit is not an aid to law-keeping;
the Spirit is the new operating system.
</p>

<p>
This is why Paul contrasts:
flesh vs Spirit,
slave vs son,
law vs promise.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>How to Read Galatians Here</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Assume fulfillment, not delay</li>
  <li>Read “law” covenantally, not morally</li>
  <li>Do not soften Paul’s language</li>
  <li>Let New Creation mean exactly what it says</li>
</ul>

<p>
Galatians is not gentle.
But it is freeing.
</p>
