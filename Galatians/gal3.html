<h1>Galatians 3</h1>
<h2>Promise Fulfilled · Law Exposed · New Covenant Identity</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase (Galatians 3)</h2>

<p><strong>3:1–5</strong> You foolish Galatians—who has bewitched you? Before your eyes Jesus the Messiah was publicly portrayed as crucified. Let me ask you just one thing: did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by the flesh? Did you experience so much for nothing? Does God supply the Spirit and work power among you because you keep the law, or because you trusted what you heard?</p>

<p><strong>3:6–9</strong> Abraham trusted God, and it was counted to him as righteousness. Know this: those who live by faith are Abraham’s true children. Scripture foresaw that God would justify the nations by faith and announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham: “All the nations will be blessed in you.” So those who trust are blessed together with faithful Abraham.</p>

<p><strong>3:10–14</strong> All who rely on works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in everything written in the book of the law.” It is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because “the righteous will live by faith.” The law is not based on faith. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations, and so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</p>

<p><strong>3:15–18</strong> Brothers and sisters, even human covenants are not set aside once confirmed. The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his Seed—not “seeds,” meaning many, but “Seed,” meaning one, who is Christ. The law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not cancel the covenant previously confirmed by God. If inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise—but God granted it to Abraham through promise.</p>

<p><strong>3:19–22</strong> Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should come to whom the promise was made. It was mediated through angels by a mediator. But God is one. The law does not oppose the promises of God, but if a law had been given that could give life, righteousness would indeed be by law. Instead, Scripture shut everything up under sin, so that the promise by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p>

<p><strong>3:23–29</strong> Before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. So the law was our guardian until Christ, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female—for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.</p>

<h2>Immediate Context (Who / What / Why)</h2>
<p>
Paul now dismantles the theological core of law-based identity.
The Galatians are being told the law completes what Christ began.
Paul responds by showing that the law never had the power to give life,
never defined inheritance,
and was never intended to be permanent.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Commentary (New Covenant / New Creation Lens)</h2>

<h3>1) The Spirit proves the covenant has changed</h3>
<p>
Paul begins with experience, not theory.
The Galatians received the Spirit before law observance.
That alone proves the covenant has shifted.
You do not receive New Covenant life through Old Covenant means.
</p>

<h3>2) Abraham predates the law — and defines inheritance</h3>
<p>
Paul reaches behind Moses to Abraham.
This is deliberate.
If inheritance is grounded in promise,
then the law cannot redefine the terms.
The law arrives later and serves a different role.
</p>

<h3>3) “Curse” is covenant consequence, not mystical doom</h3>
<p>
The curse of the law is its built-in condemnation.
It demands total compliance and offers no remedy.
Christ does not absorb random punishment;
He ends the covenant that produces the curse
by taking its verdict upon Himself.
</p>

<h3>4) The law had a time-bound function</h3>
<p>
Paul is explicit: the law was added “until.”
It guarded, restrained, and exposed sin,
but it could not heal or give life.
Once Christ arrives,
the guardian’s role is complete.
</p>

<h3>5) “Faith has come” signals covenant arrival</h3>
<p>
This is not about personal belief techniques.
“Faith has come” means the promised covenant reality
has arrived in Christ.
With its arrival,
the law’s authority ends.
</p>

<h3>6) One Seed, one people, one inheritance</h3>
<p>
Union with Christ dissolves every former boundary.
Ethnic, social, and gender distinctions
no longer define access or status.
New Creation identity replaces all prior markers.

<h2>New Creation Reality (Today)</h2>
<p>
Galatians 3 ends comparison.
You are not waiting to qualify.
You are not progressing toward belonging.
If you are in Christ, you are already an heir.
Any system that reintroduces hierarchy or delay
denies the promise and revives the guardian.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where might I still be acting as though inheritance must be earned
rather than received?
