<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus enters Jerusalem for the final week of His earthly mission. 
Every action in this chapter—the donkey, the temple cleansing, the fig tree—is a prophetic sign aimed at the religious leadership. 
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>the Old Covenant Temple is no longer the house of God, but has become a barrier that must be cleared to make way for the New Creation.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Triumphal Entry (21:1–11)</h3>
<p>
Approaching Jerusalem, Jesus sent two disciples to find a donkey and its colt, fulfilling the prophecy: "Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey." 
The crowds spread their garments and branches on the road, shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord!" 
The whole city was stirred, asking, "Who is this?" The crowds replied, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Jesus enters as the Prince of Peace, not a war-lord. He is arriving to finalize the Covenant, not to uphold the physical walls of the city.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Cleansing the Temple (21:12–17)</h3>
<p>
Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who bought and sold, overturning the tables of the money changers. 
"It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of thieves!" 
The blind and the lame came to Him <strong>in the temple</strong>, and He healed them. 
When the chief priests saw these wonders and heard children shouting Hosanna, they were indignant. 
Jesus replied, "Have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have prepared praise'?"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> By healing the blind and lame inside the temple, Jesus was doing what the Law's shadow could not—providing actual restoration where the old system only provided commerce.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Cursing of the Fig Tree (21:18–22)</h3>
<p>
In the morning, being hungry, He saw a fig tree with only leaves but no fruit. 
He said, "Let no fruit ever grow on you again!" Instantly, the tree withered. 
The disciples were amazed. Jesus said, "If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do this, 
but you could say to <strong>this mountain</strong>, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and it would happen."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The fig tree represents Israel’s religious system—full of the "leaves" of ritual but lacking the fruit of the Spirit. "This mountain" is the Temple Mount, which was about to be removed from its position of authority.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Authority of the Son (21:23–32)</h3>
<p>
The priests questioned His authority. Jesus asked them in return, "Was John’s baptism from heaven or from men?" 
They were trapped; if they said "heaven," He would ask why they didn't believe; if they said "men," they feared the people. 
They said, "We don't know." Jesus replied, "Then neither will I tell you My authority." 
He told a parable of two sons: one who refused but later obeyed, and one who promised but didn't. 
"Tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the Kingdom before you," He told the leaders.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Authority in the New Covenant is recognized by the heart, not by a title in the old hierarchy.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Parable of the Wicked Tenants (21:33–46)</h3>
<p>
A landowner planted a vineyard and leased it to tenants. When he sent servants to collect fruit, the tenants beat and killed them. 
Finally, he sent his son, saying, "They will respect my son." But they killed the son to take his inheritance. 
Jesus asked, "What will the owner do?" The leaders replied, "He will destroy those wretches and give the vineyard to others." 
Jesus said, "The stone the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. 
<strong>The Kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation producing its fruit.</strong>"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> This is a direct prophecy of the AD 70 transition. The "nation" receiving the Kingdom is the New Creation people (Jew and Gentile) who live by the Finished Work.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Prince of Peace vs. The Zealots</h3>
<p>
By riding a donkey, Jesus was intentionally de-escalating the carnal expectations of the Jewish people. 
They wanted a military king to save the Temple; He came as a humble King to <strong>replace</strong> the Temple.
</p>

<h3>2) The Den of Thieves</h3>
<p>
A "den of thieves" is not just a place where people steal; it is a hideout where criminals go to feel safe after their crimes. 
The religious leaders were using the Temple rituals as a "hideout" from true righteousness. 
Jesus’ cleansing was a legal eviction notice.
</p>

<h3>3) The Withered Fig Tree and "This Mountain"</h3>
<p>
In Hebrew imagery, the fig tree and the mountain are synonyms for Israel and the Temple Mount. 
Jesus isn't teaching "magic" to move literal mountains; He is prophesying the <strong>removal of the Old Covenant system.</strong> 
By faith, the disciples would see the Temple Mount "cast into the sea" (judged among the nations) as the New Covenant was established.
</p>

<h3>4) The Cornerstone</h3>
<p>
The "builders" (the Sanhedrin) rejected the very Stone required to hold the structure together. 
In the Finished Work, Christ is the Cornerstone of a living Temple. 
The old structure collapsed because it refused to rest on Him.
</p>

<h3>5) Taking the Kingdom</h3>
<p>
Jesus explicitly states that the Kingdom would be **taken away** from the physical lineage and institutional leadership of Israel. 
The "inheritance" is no longer tied to a piece of land in the Middle East, but to the fruit-bearing Life of the New Creation.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 21 shows us that we are part of the "nation" that has been given the Kingdom. 
We don't look to a physical mountain or a building for our security. 
The "fruitless" ways of religious performance have been withered by the Word of Christ. 
We live as the "babes and infants" who have seen the King and are not afraid to shout His praise in the midst of the collapsing old world.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still trying to find "fruit" on the withered tree of my own religious performance?
</p>
<p>
Do I recognize the authority of the Cornerstone in my life, or am I still trying to "build" my own version of the Kingdom?
</p>
