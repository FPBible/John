<h1>Matthew 26</h1>
<h2>The Passover of the New Covenant and the Cup of the Son</h2>

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
The Olivet Discourse is finished. Jesus now turns to the "Appointed Time." 
The religious leaders plot His death while He prepares His disciples for the <strong>ratification</strong> of the New Covenant through the breaking of His body and the pouring out of His blood.
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>Jesus is the True Passover Lamb who willingly drinks the cup of the Old Covenant's judgment so that we can drink the New Wine of the Kingdom.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Anointing of the King (26:1–13)</h3>
<p>
After finishing His teaching on the end of the age, Jesus told His disciples, "In two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified." 
Meanwhile, the chief priests plotted to seize Him by stealth. 
While Jesus was in Bethany, a woman came with a jar of expensive perfume and poured it on His head. 
The disciples complained about the "waste," but Jesus corrected them: "She has done a good work. She has anointed My body for burial. 
Wherever this Good News is announced in the <strong>whole world</strong>, what she has done will be remembered."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The perfume represents the "Anointing" of the High Priest and King. Her act recognizes the value of the Finished Work before it is even completed.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The New Covenant Supper (26:14–30)</h3>
<p>
Judas agreed to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. On the first day of Unleavened Bread, Jesus sat with the twelve. 
As they ate, He took bread, blessed it, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body." 
Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "Drink from it, all of you; for <strong>this is My blood of the New Covenant</strong>, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 
I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine again until that day when I drink it <strong>New</strong> with you in My Father’s Kingdom."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Jesus is officially retiring the Old Covenant Passover. The "New Wine" is the life of the Spirit that we now share in the established Kingdom.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Gethsemane: The Cup of Judgment (26:31–46)</h3>
<p>
Jesus told them they would all fall away that night, fulfilling the prophecy: "I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered." 
In Gethsemane, He began to be deeply distressed. He prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; <strong>yet not as I will, but as You will.</strong>" 
He found the disciples sleeping three times, saying, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." 
Finally, He said, "The hour has arrived. The Son of Man is being betrayed."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "cup" was the legal weight of the Old Covenant curse. Jesus’ submission in the garden was the "Yes" that allowed the Finished Work to proceed.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Arrest and the Refusal of Force (26:47–56)</h3>
<p>
Judas arrived with a crowd armed with swords. He betrayed Jesus with a kiss. 
When one of the disciples cut off the ear of the high priest's servant, Jesus said, "Put your sword back. All who take the sword will perish by it. 
Do you not think I could call twelve legions of messengers from My Father? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled?" 
Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The Kingdom does not use the weapons of the old world. Jesus’ "surrender" was actually His offensive move to dismantle the power of death.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Trial Before the Sanhedrin (26:57–75)</h3>
<p>
They led Him to Caiaphas, where false witnesses tried to find a charge. 
Finally, the high priest said, "I adjure You by the living God: tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!" 
Jesus replied, "It is as you said. Moreover, I tell you: <strong>From now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.</strong>" 
They cried "Blasphemy!" and condemned Him to death. Meanwhile, Peter denied Jesus three times, just as Jesus had predicted, and wept bitterly.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Jesus’ quote of "coming on the clouds" (v. 64) was a legal warning to the high priest. It signaled that Caiaphas was about to see his own system judged by the seated King.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Termination of the Old Passover</h3>
<p>
By saying "this is My blood of the New Covenant," Jesus was legally declaring the Mosaic Passover to be a shadow that had met its substance. 
In the Finished Work, we don't look back to the blood on the doorposts of Egypt; 
we look to the blood poured out once for all that has secured our permanent exit from the world of sin and death.
</p>

<h3>2) The Value of the Ointment</h3>
<p>
The disciples saw "waste"; Jesus saw "preparation." 
The Finished Work is often viewed as "too much" or "scandalous" by those stuck in a religious mindset of frugality and merit. 
The woman’s gift recognizes that nothing is too valuable for the One who is about to pay the ultimate price.
</p>

<h3>3) The Cup of the Curse</h3>
<p>
In Gethsemane, Jesus was not fearing physical pain; He was facing the judicial weight of the Law's curse. 
By drinking this cup, He exhausted the "wrath" of the old system against humanity. 
Because He drank it, the cup He hands to us is only filled with "New Wine"—the joy of the Spirit.
</p>

<h3>4) Sitting at the Right Hand</h3>
<p>
When Jesus told the Sanhedrin they would see Him "sitting at the right hand of Power," He was claiming the fulfillment of Psalm 110. 
This was a direct threat to their authority. 
He was telling them that the very One they were "judging" was actually the One who would shortly judge their Temple and city.
</p>

<h3>5) The Failure of the Flesh</h3>
<p>
Peter’s denial and the disciples' flight prove that "flesh and blood" cannot sustain a New Covenant walk. 
The Finished Work is not based on our "loyalty" or "staying awake," but on Christ’s faithfulness. 
Our restoration (like Peter's) is a gift of the Finished Work, not a result of our own effort to "do better next time."

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 26 shows us that our place at the table is secured by the blood of Christ. 
We don't live in the "weakness of the flesh" or the "denial of Peter." 
We live in the **Rest** of Gethsemane's victory—where the Father's will was done through the Son. 
We drink the "New Wine" of the Kingdom today, knowing that the cup of judgment has been drained 
and our forgiveness is a legal, finished fact.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still trying to "stay awake" by my own strength, or am I resting in the finished victory of Jesus in the Garden?
</p>
<p>
Do I see the "Lord's Supper" as a ritual to be performed, or as a feast of the New Covenant life I already possess?
</p>
