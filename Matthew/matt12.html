<h2>Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath.
His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said,
“Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath.”
</p>

<p>
Jesus answered,
“Have you not read what David did when he was hungry,
he and those with him?
How he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence,
which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him,
but only for the priests?”
</p>

<p>
“Or have you not read in the Law
that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath
and are guiltless?
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
If you had known what this means,
‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’
you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
</p>

<p>
He went on from there and entered their synagogue.
A man was there with a withered hand.
They asked Him,
“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
so that they might accuse Him.
</p>

<p>
He said to them,
“Which one of you, if he has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath,
will not take hold of it and lift it out?
How much more valuable is a man than a sheep!
So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”
</p>

<p>
Then He said to the man,
“Stretch out your hand.”
And the hand was restored, healthy like the other.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired how to destroy Him.
</p>

<p>
Aware of this, Jesus withdrew.
Many followed Him, and He healed them all
and ordered them not to make Him known,
to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
</p>

<p class="small">
“Behold My servant whom I have chosen,
My beloved in whom My soul delights.
I will put My Spirit upon Him,
and He will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not quarrel or cry aloud,
nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
A bruised reed He will not break,
and a smoldering wick He will not quench,
until He brings justice to victory.
And in His name the nations will hope.”
</p>

<p>
Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him,
and He healed him,
so that the man spoke and saw.
All the crowds were amazed and said,
“Could this be the Son of David?”
</p>

<p>
But when the Pharisees heard it, they said,
“It is only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons,
that this man casts out demons.”
</p>

<p>
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said,
“Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste.
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself.
How then will his kingdom stand?”
</p>

<p>
“But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God,
then the kingdom of God has come upon you.”
</p>

<p>
“How can someone enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods,
unless he first binds the strong man?
Then indeed he may plunder his house.”
</p>

<p>
“Whoever is not with Me is against Me,
and whoever does not gather with Me scatters.”
</p>

<p>
“Therefore I tell you,
every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people,
but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven,
but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit
will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.”
</p>

<p>
“Either make the tree good and its fruit good,
or make the tree bad and its fruit bad,
for the tree is known by its fruit.
You brood of vipers!
How can you speak good when you are evil?
For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.”
</p>

<p>
“I tell you, on the day of judgment
people will give account for every careless word they speak.
For by your words you will be justified,
and by your words you will be condemned.”
</p>

<p>
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said,
“Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.”
</p>

<p>
But He answered,
“An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign,
but no sign will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
For just as Jonah was three days and three nights
in the belly of the great fish,
so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights
in the heart of the land.”
</p>

<p>
“The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation
and condemn it,
for they repented at the preaching of Jonah,
and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.”
</p>

<p>
“The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation
and condemn it,
for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.”
</p>

<p>
“When an unclean spirit goes out of a person,
it passes through waterless places seeking rest.
Then it says,
‘I will return to my house from which I came.’
And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.
Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself,
and the last state of that person is worse than the first.
So also will it be with this evil generation.”
</p>

<p>
While He was still speaking, His mother and brothers stood outside,
asking to speak to Him.
But He replied,
“Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”
Stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said,
“Here are My mother and My brothers!
For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven
is My brother and sister and mother.”
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Sabbath controversy exposes the <b>collapse of Sinai authority</b>.</li>
  <li>“Lord of the Sabbath” signals jurisdictional transfer.</li>
  <li>“The kingdom has come upon you” is present, not delayed.</li>
  <li>“This generation” is the repeated covenant target.</li>
  <li>The “unclean spirit” parable describes Israel’s post-reform relapse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>End of the Law — Sabbath Ends in the Son</h2>
<p>
The Sabbath was the sign of the Mosaic covenant.
By declaring Himself Lord of the Sabbath,
Jesus asserts authority over the covenant itself.
</p>

<p>
Mercy over sacrifice is not rule-bending —
it is covenant replacement.
The Law’s function is being eclipsed
by the presence of the Son.
</p>

<p class="note">
You do not improve the Sabbath.
You outgrow it when the covenant it belonged to ends.
</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
The family of God is no longer defined by bloodline,
tribe, or Law observance,
but by participation in the will of the Father through the Son.
</p>

<p>
Rest is not a day.
Rest is a Person.
