  <h1>Matthew 1</h1>

  <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
  <p>Matthew opens the Gospel account by anchoring the arrival of the Messiah in the legal and covenantal history of Israel. This chapter provides the bridge from the Old Covenant to the New Creation, documenting the royal lineage of Jesus and the miraculous nature of His entry into the world as the fulfillment of the Davidic and Abrahamic promises.</p>

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
  <h3>1. The Genesis of the New Heavens and Earth</h3>
  <p>The Greek phrase <i>Biblos geneseos</i> in verse 1 is much more than a simple introduction to a family tree; it is a deliberate theological echo of Genesis 2:4 and 5:1. Matthew is announcing a "New Genesis." In the Full Preterist framework, this marks the official beginning of the transition from the Old Covenant age to the New Creation. The genealogy is not just a list of names; it is a legal document proving that the system of the Law has reached its climax in a single Person. For centuries, Israel had been defined by biological lineage and the physical land, but Matthew presents Jesus as the "Last Adam" who sums up the entire history of the Old World. This record identifies the one who would eventually dismantle the shadows of the Law and fully inaugurate the New Creation. By the time the Temple was destroyed in AD 70, the need for such physical genealogies was removed because the spiritual lineage of the Kingdom had been firmly established. We are no longer defined by the generations of the first Adam, but by the "scroll" of the King. This transition was the essential work of the first century—moving from a fleshly identification to a spiritual one. The genealogical records kept in the Temple served their purpose until the Messiah appeared; once the substance arrived, the shadows were legally ready to be dismissed.</p>

  <h3>2. The Sabbatical Climax of History</h3>
  <p>Matthew organizes the lineage into three sets of fourteen generations. This numerical arrangement is a sophisticated theological manifesto. In Hebrew gematria, the name "David" (D-V-D) equals 14. Matthew is shouting to his readers that Jesus is the "Thrice-Davidic" King, the ultimate heir to the throne. Furthermore, 3 sets of 14 equal 42 generations, which correlates precisely to the 42 encampments of Israel in the wilderness as recorded in the Torah. History has reached its destination; the wandering of the Old Covenant people is over. From a fulfilled perspective, this is the final "countdown" to the end of the Mosaic Age. The sabbatical rest that Israel could never find under the Law was now being offered in the person of Christ. This was the "fullness of time" mentioned by Paul, signaling that the "elements of the world" were about to be put away to make room for the eternal, spiritual Kingdom that we now inhabit as a settled reality. The structure of the genealogy proves that God is a God of order and timing; the Old Covenant was never meant to be permanent, but was a timed period of tutelage leading directly to the Christ. When the 42nd generation arrived, the "wilderness" period of the Law was legally terminated, and the entrance into the New Creation "Land" began.</p>

  <h3>3. The Removal of the Covenant Curse</h3>
  <p>When the messenger tells Joseph that Jesus will "save His people from their sins," it is vital to understand this in a first-century covenantal context rather than through the lens of modern individualistic pietism. "His people" refers specifically to Israel, and "their sins" specifically points to the corporate transgressions under the Law of Moses that had kept the nation in spiritual exile and under the threat of death. The Old Covenant could only identify and multiply sin; it could never truly remove it. Jesus came to fulfill the Law’s requirements and bear the curse of the Law on behalf of the remnant of Israel. This salvation was not a future-tense event for us today, but a historically completed act for the people of that age. It was inaugurated in Matthew 1, secured at the Cross, and fully consummated at the Parousia in AD 70 when the Law—which Paul called the "strength of sin"—was legally and physically retired along with the Temple system. Today, we do not live under the threat of the Mosaic curse or in a state of "waiting" for salvation to be finished. We live in the freedom of a salvation that is already finished and applied to the New Creation people. The "sins" that separated God from His people have been dealt with once for all, and the barrier of the Law has been removed forever.</p>

  <h3>4. Immanuel: The End of Localized Presence</h3>
  <p>The name "Immanuel" (God with us) signifies the most radical shift in human history: the transition from a localized presence in a stone temple to the indwelling presence of God in His people. Full Preterism recognizes that the true "Temple" is no longer a building in Jerusalem, but the corporate body of Christ. Matthew 1 introduces the concept that would be fully realized when the physical Temple in Jerusalem fell. The "with us" reality was no longer restricted by veils, human priests, or animal sacrifices. Because Christ fulfilled every shadow, the presence of God is now an immediate, direct, and constant reality for the believer. We live in the "New Jerusalem" where the tabernacle of God is with men (Rev 21:3). This wasn't a hope for a distant future; it was the entire purpose of Christ's entry into the world. In the New Creation, there is no more "distance" between God and His people, as the Old Covenant barriers have been permanently removed. The arrival of Immanuel meant that the "heaven and earth" of the old system had to pass away to make way for a world where God and man are perfectly reconciled. This reconciliation is not something we are waiting for in a second "coming"—it is the settled state of the New Creation which we currently inhabit. The presence of God is the air we breathe in the Kingdom.</p>

  <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
  <p>You are no longer a child of the flesh or a servant of the Law. Because of the "Genesis" recorded here, you are a citizen of the New Creation. The King has arrived, the debt has been paid, and "God with us" is your present, daily reality. The transition is over; you live in the settled Kingdom of God where you have direct access to the Father.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Do you still view your relationship with God through the "shadows" of effort and distance, or do you rest in the finished work of Immanuel?</p>
