<h1>Matthew 1</h1>
<h2>The Genesis of the New Covenant</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Scripture</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">2</span> Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren,
    <span class="v-num">3</span> and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,
    <span class="v-num">4</span> and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
    <span class="v-num">5</span> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
    <span class="v-num">6</span> and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon, of her [who had been] Uriah’s,
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">7</span> and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,
    <span class="v-num">8</span> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,
    <span class="v-num">9</span> and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,
    <span class="v-num">10</span> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah,
    <span class="v-num">11</span> and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">12</span> And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,
    <span class="v-num">13</span> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
    <span class="v-num">14</span> and Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
    <span class="v-num">15</span> and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
    <span class="v-num">16</span> and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">17</span> All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal to the Christ fourteen generations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">18</span> And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found having [conception] in the womb from the Holy Spirit,
    <span class="v-num">19</span> and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">20</span> And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the LORD in a dream appeared to him, saying, “Joseph, son of David, thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which in her was begotten [is] of the Holy Spirit,
    <span class="v-num">21</span> and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">22</span> And all this hath come to pass, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
    <span class="v-num">23</span> “Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,” which is, being interpreted, “With us [is] God.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">24</span> And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the LORD directed him, and received his wife,
    <span class="v-num">25</span> and did not know her till she brought forth her son—the first-born—and he called his name Jesus.

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<div class="annotation-block">
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>1:17 — Babylonian removal:</strong> Literally "deportation" or "exile." Marks the covenantal timeline of Israel’s judgment.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>1:21 — His people:</strong> Contextually restricted to Israel (the covenant people).</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>1:21 — Their sins:</strong> Refers to the covenant-breaking trespasses that caused the Exile, rather than generic moral failure.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>1:23 — With us [is] God:</strong> Signifies the restoration of God’s presence returning to His people, replacing the need for a physical Temple.</div>
</div>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
<p>
Matthew opens his Gospel not with a biography, but with a legal brief. To a first-century Jewish audience, a King could not simply appear; he had to be proven. This genealogy establishes Jesus as the legal heir to the throne of David through Joseph. This was critical because the official genealogical records were housed in the Temple. By recording this before AD 70, Matthew preserved the legal right of Messiahship before the records were permanently destroyed by the Roman legions.
</p>
<p>
The structure of "three sets of fourteen" is not merely a memory aid; it is a theological timeline. Matthew divides Israel's history into three epochs: Foundation (Abraham to David), Monarchy (David to Exile), and Decline (Exile to Messiah). The third set ends with Jesus, indicating that the period of Decline and Exile is officially over. The "fullness of time" has arrived. There is no fourth set of fourteen; Jesus is the terminal point of the Old Covenant line and the beginning of the New Creation.
</p>
<p>
The angel’s instruction in verse 21 defines the mission of the Messiah with precision: "He shall save His people from their sins." In the context of the first century, this is not a generic promise of going to heaven. It is the resolution of the "Great Divorce." Israel was in exile (spiritual and political) because of her sins—specifically, the violation of the Mosaic Covenant. Jesus comes as the Greater Joshua ("Yahweh Saves") to pay the debt of the Old Covenant, ending the curse of the Law. He is "Immanuel"—God returning to dwell with His people, signaling that the physical Temple is now obsolete and ready to vanish.

<h2>Devotional</h2>
<p>
We do not wait for a Messiah to come; the genealogy is complete. We live on the other side of the "Three Fourteens." The silence of God has been permanently broken. We are the generation that lives in the reality of Immanuel—God permanently with us, no longer separated by veil, priest, or temple.
</p>
<p>
Do I live as if God is "with us" right now, or am I still waiting for Him to show up? If Jesus resolved the "sins of His people" and ended the Exile, why do I often feel the burden of distance from God? The genealogy proves God keeps His appointments; am I trusting His timing in my own life?
