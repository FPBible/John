<h1>Matthew 3</h1>
<h2>The Axe at the Root</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
After the quiet years in Nazareth, the silence is shattered by a voice in the wilderness. Matthew introduces John the Baptist not as a revivalist, but as a herald announcing a regime change. The "Kingdom of Heaven" is no longer a distant promise; it is an imminent threat to the established order. The transition from the Old Covenant to the New is about to begin, starting with a call to separate from the corrupt generation of Israel.

<h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> And in those days cometh John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,
    <span class="v-num">2</span> and saying, “Reform, for the kingdom of the heavens hath come nigh!”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">3</span> For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, straight make ye His paths.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">4</span> And this John had his clothing of camel’s hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field.
    <span class="v-num">5</span> Then were going forth to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,
    <span class="v-num">6</span> and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">7</span> And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, “Brood of vipers! Who did show you to flee from the coming wrath?
    <span class="v-num">8</span> Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,
    <span class="v-num">9</span> and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have—Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,
    <span class="v-num">10</span> and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">11</span> “I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,
    <span class="v-num">12</span> whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">13</span> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan unto John to be baptized by him,
    <span class="v-num">14</span> but John was forbidding him, saying, “I have need by thee to be baptized—and thou dost come unto me?”
    <span class="v-num">15</span> But Jesus answering said to him, “Suffer [it] now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,” then he doth suffer him.
    <span class="v-num">16</span> And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,
    <span class="v-num">17</span> and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, “This is My Son—the Beloved, in whom I did delight.”
  </p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<div class="annotation-block">
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>3:2 — Hath come nigh:</strong> Literally "is at hand." A time-statement indicating the Kingdom was arriving in that generation, not thousands of years later.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>3:7 — The coming wrath:</strong> Refers specifically to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, which these Pharisees would face in their lifetime.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>3:10 — Axe at the root:</strong> The judgment is final and already positioned. God is not pruning the tree of National Israel; He is cutting it down to plant the New Covenant.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>3:12 — Unquenchable fire:</strong> Covenantal judgment language. "Unquenchable" means a fire that cannot be put out until it consumes the target (Jerusalem), not a fire that burns forever in eternity.</div>
</div>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Deadline Has Arrived</h3>
<p>
John’s message is driven by urgency. "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand" is not a timeless religious slogan; it is a countdown. The arrival of the King means the expiration of the Old Order. The silence of the prophets is broken by a final warning: the transition is starting <em>now</em>. The Pharisees are warned to flee from "the wrath about to come" (Greek <em>mello</em>), placing the judgment of Jerusalem squarely within their generation.
</p>

<h3>2) The Baptism of Fire is Judgment</h3>
<p>
Contrary to popular teaching, the "baptism of fire" in verse 11 is not a positive spiritual experience to be sought; it is a judgment to be feared. The context (v. 12) clarifies the metaphor: the Messiah comes with a winnowing fan to separate the wheat (the Remnant believers) from the chaff (apostate Israel). The wheat is gathered into the barn (the Kingdom/Church), but the chaff is burned with unquenchable fire (the AD 70 destruction). To be baptized with fire was to be consumed in the judgment of the Jewish nation.
</p>

<h3>3) Ending the Ethnic Claim</h3>
<p>
John strikes at the heart of Old Covenant security: "Do not say... we have Abraham as our father." In the New Covenant, biological lineage is irrelevant. The "axe is laid at the root" of the genealogical tree. God is creating a new family defined by faith in the Messiah, not bloodline. This marks the end of the "fleshly" covenant and the beginning of the spiritual Reality.
</p>

<h3>4) Fulfilling All Righteousness</h3>
<p>
Jesus insists on baptism to "fulfill all righteousness." He is not repenting of sin; He is identifying with the faithful Remnant of Israel. By entering the water, He validates John’s ministry as the bridge between the Old and New, and He formally accepts His anointing as the King who will execute this covenant transition.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
The axe has already swung. The tree of the Old Covenant order was cut down in AD 70, and the fire has done its work. We do not live in fear of the "wrath to come" because it has already come and gone. We are the "wheat" gathered into the barn—safe, secure, and living in the age of the Holy Spirit. We don't need to flee to the wilderness; we live in the finished City of God.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still trying to "prepare the way" for a King who has already arrived, or am I walking in the paths He has already made straight? Do I live with the anxiety of a looming judgment, or the peace of a gathered harvest?
