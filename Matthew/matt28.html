<h1>Matthew 28</h1>
<h2>The Resurrection and the Commission of the New Age</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
The Sabbath is over. The King has rested from His work of the New Creation just as God rested on the seventh day of the first. 
This chapter records the discovery of the empty tomb, the defeat of the religious cover-up, and the final instructions to the disciples.
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>Jesus has been given all authority in heaven and on earth, and His presence remains the anchor of the transition from the Old Age to the New.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Earthquake and the Empty Tomb (28:1–10)</h3>
<p>
As the first day of the week dawned, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to the tomb. 
Suddenly, there was a great earthquake; a messenger of the Lord descended, rolled away the stone, and sat on it. 
His appearance was like lightning. The guards shook with fear and became like dead men. 
The messenger said to the women, "Do not be afraid. He is not here; <strong>He has been raised, just as He said.</strong> Come, see the place where He lay." 
As they ran to tell the disciples, Jesus met them: "Rejoice!" They fell at His feet and worshiped Him. 
He said, "Do not be afraid. Go tell My brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see Me."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The earthquake signifies the shaking of the foundations of the old world. The "Sabbath" of the Law is over; the "Eighth Day" of the New Creation has begun.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Corruption of the Old Guards (28:11–15)</h3>
<p>
While the women were going, the guards reported everything to the chief priests. 
The leaders gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, telling them to lie: "Say His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept." 
They promised to keep the guards out of trouble with the governor. 
So they took the money and spread the story, which is still told among those who cling to the old system to this day.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The religious system that began with a "bribe" to Judas ends with a "bribe" to the guards. It is a system built on debt and deception, unable to handle the light of the Truth.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Great Commission: Global Authority (28:16–20)</h3>
<p>
The eleven disciples went to the mountain in Galilee. When they saw Him, they worshiped, though some still hesitated. 
Jesus came near and said to them: "<strong>All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.</strong> 
Go, therefore, and disciple all the nations, immersing them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, 
teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. 
And behold, <strong>I am with you all the days until the completion of the age.</strong>"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "completion of the age" (<em>Sunteleia</em>) refers to the 40-year transition period ending in AD 70. Jesus promised His specific "miraculous" presence to guide the Apostles as they dismantled the Old Covenant and established the New.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Eighth Day Reality</h3>
<p>
The Resurrection happened on the "first day of the week." 
In biblical typology, this is the **Eighth Day**—the day beyond the seven days of the old creation. 
The Finished Work means we no longer live under the "weekly cycle" of the Law’s requirements; 
we live in the "Eternal Today" of the Resurrection.
</p>

<h3>2) All Authority (Exousia)</h3>
<p>
Jesus did not say He *would* have authority one day; He said He *has* it now. 
The Finished Work is not a "future plan"; it is a **Current Reign**. 
If Jesus has all authority on earth, then no religious system, political power, or "old world" curse has a legal right to govern the believer.
</p>

<h3>3) The Baptism into the Name</h3>
<p>
To be "immersed into the Name" is to be fully identified with the Nature of God. 
In the New Covenant, we are not baptized into a set of rules, but into a **Family Identity**. 
The "Name" (singular) of the Father, Son, and Spirit is the new dwelling place of the believer.
</p>

<h3>4) The Completion of the Age (Sunteleia)</h3>
<p>
The phrase "end of the world" in many Bibles is a mistranslation of *Sunteleia tou Aionos*. 
Jesus was promising to be with that specific group of disciples through the "birth pains" and "tribulation" of the transition. 
He was with them until the Old Age was fully consumed in AD 70, 
at which point the New Covenant was the only system standing.
</p>

<h3>5) From the Mountain to the Nations</h3>
<p>
Matthew began with a genealogy of a Jewish King and ends with a King of all Nations. 
The Finished Work has successfully broken the "national" boundaries of the Law. 
The Kingdom is no longer a local "Israel-only" project; it is a global New Creation.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 28 reveals that the "Finished Work" is a living power. 
We do not serve a dead prophet but a Risen King. 
The "guards" of the old world are paralyzed by fear, but we walk in the joy of the Resurrection. 
We have been immersed into the Name and the Nature of God. 
The "Age of the Law" has been completed; we are now the citizens of the **Unshakeable Kingdom** where Christ is with us, in us, and through us, forever.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still acting like the "stone" is in front of the tomb, or am I living in the freedom of the earthquake?
</p>
<p>
If Jesus has "All Authority" right now, what "old world" voice am I still allowing to speak into my life?
</p>
