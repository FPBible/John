<h1>Matthew 4</h1>
<h2>The True Son Tested, the Kingdom Proclaimed</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT04.htm" target="_blank">Matthew 4 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew now presents Jesus as Israel-in-person.
Where Israel failed in the wilderness, the Son remains faithful.
This is not private temptation—it is covenant testing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Son in the wilderness (4:1–11)</h3>
<p>
Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tested.
After fasting forty days, He was hungry.
</p>
<p>
The tempter said, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.”
Jesus replied, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word from God.”
</p>
<p>
Again He resisted the test—refusing spectacle, refusing power without obedience.
Then the tempter departed.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Jesus succeeds where Israel failed—faithful Sonship under covenant testing.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Light dawns in Galilee (4:12–17)</h3>
<p>
Jesus went into Galilee and began proclaiming,
“Change your mind—the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.”
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note (Isaiah 9):</strong> Light dawning in Galilee signals restoration beginning where darkness once ruled.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The King calls disciples (4:18–25)</h3>
<p>
Jesus called ordinary fishermen, saying,
“Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of people.”
They immediately followed Him.
</p>
<p>
He taught, healed, and announced the kingdom throughout the region.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The wilderness test is covenant replay</h3>
<p>
Forty days mirrors Israel’s forty years.
Jesus quotes Torah not to defend legalism,
but to demonstrate faithful covenant obedience.
</p>

<h3>2) Power without obedience is rejected</h3>
<p>
Every temptation offers shortcut kingship.
Jesus refuses rule without submission.
This defines the kingdom’s nature.
</p>

<h3>3) Galilee is deliberate</h3>
<p>
The kingdom does not begin in Jerusalem’s power centers.
It begins in neglected regions—exposing false expectations.
</p>

<h3>4) Repentance remains the message</h3>
<p>
The message does not change from John to Jesus.
What changes is the authority behind it.
</p>

<h3>5) Discipleship replaces institution</h3>
<p>
Jesus builds the kingdom through people, not systems.
Followership replaces hierarchy.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
The kingdom advances through obedience, not spectacle.
Authority flows from faithfulness, not dominance.
The Son stands firm—so the kingdom stands secure.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I tempted to grasp authority without obedience?
And where is Christ calling me out of comfort into participation?
</p>
