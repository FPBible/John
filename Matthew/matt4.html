<h1>Matthew 3</h1>
<h2>The Kingdom Announced, the Axe Raised</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://ebible.org/eng-web/MAT03.htm" target="_blank">Matthew 3 — WEB</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew now moves from lineage and birth to confrontation. John appears not as a spiritual warm-up act,
but as a covenant prosecutor. His message is not vague repentance—it is an urgent announcement:
the kingdom is arriving, and judgment is imminent for an unfruitful system.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>A voice in the wilderness (3:1–6)</h3>
<p>
John came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
“Change your mind—because the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.”
</p>
<p>
This is the one spoken of by Isaiah: “A voice crying in the wilderness,
prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.”
</p>
<p>
People from Jerusalem, Judea, and the Jordan region went out to him,
confessing their sins and being immersed in the Jordan.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note (Isaiah 40):</strong> John announces covenant transition—the end of exile language now being activated.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The axe is already at the root (3:7–12)</h3>
<p>
When John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming, he said,
“You offspring of vipers—who warned you to flee the coming wrath?
Produce fruit consistent with repentance.”
</p>
<p>
“Do not presume, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’
God can raise children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already laid at the root of the trees.
Every tree not bearing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
</p>
<p>
“I immerse you in water for repentance,
but One coming after me will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire.”
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Fire and axe imagery target covenant fruitlessness, not end-of-the-world destruction.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Son revealed (3:13–17)</h3>
<p>
Jesus came to John to be baptized.
When He came up from the water, the heavens were opened,
the Spirit descended like a dove,
and a voice said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note (Son language):</strong> Jesus is identified as the faithful covenant Son—where Israel failed, He will succeed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) “The kingdom has drawn near” is an arrival announcement</h3>
<p>
John does not say the kingdom is coming someday.
He says it has drawn near—close enough to demand response.
In prophetic language, “near” always means covenant imminence, not symbolic delay.
</p>

<h3>2) Wrath language targets leadership, not humanity</h3>
<p>
John’s harshest words are directed at covenant leaders.
“Offspring of vipers” is prophetic language accusing corrupt shepherds of poisoning the people.
This is covenant lawsuit speech, not universal condemnation.
</p>

<h3>3) The axe is already positioned</h3>
<p>
The axe is not being sharpened; it is already at the root.
This means judgment is not hypothetical.
The unfruitful covenant order is about to be removed.
</p>

<h3>4) Spirit and fire are purifying, not annihilating</h3>
<p>
Fire in prophetic literature refines and judges systems.
John contrasts water immersion with Spirit-fire immersion:
the coming work of Christ will decisively separate wheat from chaff.
</p>

<h3>5) Jesus is declared Son before He acts</h3>
<p>
The Father’s declaration precedes Jesus’ ministry.
Identity is established before action.
This pattern defines New Creation life: sonship precedes obedience.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 3 announces that covenant change is not theoretical.
Systems that bear no fruit are removed.
The kingdom does not wait for readiness—it exposes reality.
In Christ, identity is given before performance.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I relying on religious inheritance rather than fruit?
And where do I resist repentance because it threatens familiarity?
</p>
