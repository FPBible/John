<h1>Matthew 4</h1>
<h2>The Test of the Son</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Having been identified as the "Son of God" at His baptism, Jesus must now prove His qualifications. Just as national Israel (God’s "firstborn son," Ex 4:22) was tested in the wilderness for 40 years, Jesus enters the wilderness for 40 days. Where Israel failed, grumbled, and tested God, Jesus succeeds. He emerges not as a hermit, but as a King announcing the immediate arrival of His government.

<h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> Then was Jesus led up into the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,
    <span class="v-num">2</span> and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger.
    <span class="v-num">3</span> And the Tempter having come to him said, “If Son thou art of God—speak that these stones may become loaves.”
    <span class="v-num">4</span> But he answering said, “It hath been written, Not upon bread alone doth man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">5</span> Then doth the Devil take him to the holy city, and doth set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
    <span class="v-num">6</span> and saith to him, “If Son thou art of God—cast thyself down, for it hath been written, that, To His messengers He shall give charge concerning thee, and on hands they shall bear thee up, that thou mayest not dash against a stone thy foot.”
    <span class="v-num">7</span> Jesus said to him, “Again it hath been written, Thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">8</span> Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mountain, and doth show to him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
    <span class="v-num">9</span> and saith to him, “All these to thee I will give, if having fallen down thou mayest bow to me.”
    <span class="v-num">10</span> Then saith Jesus to him, “Go—adversary, for it hath been written, The LORD thy God thou shalt bow to, and Him only thou shalt serve.”
    <span class="v-num">11</span> Then doth the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">12</span> And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,
    <span class="v-num">13</span> and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,
    <span class="v-num">14</span> that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
    <span class="v-num">15</span> “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!—
    <span class="v-num">16</span> the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death—light arose to them.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">17</span> From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, “Reform ye, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">18</span> And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were fishers,
    <span class="v-num">19</span> and he saith to them, “Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men,”
    <span class="v-num">20</span> and they, immediately having left the nets, followed him.
    <span class="v-num">21</span> And having advanced thence, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,
    <span class="v-num">22</span> and they, immediately having left the boat and their father, followed him.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">23</span> And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,
    <span class="v-num">24</span> and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and torments, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.
    <span class="v-num">25</span> And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<div class="annotation-block">
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>4:2 — Forty days:</strong> Typological fulfillment of Israel's 40 years in the wilderness (Deut 8:2) and Moses' 40 days on the mountain. Jesus is the faithful Israel.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>4:8 — Kingdoms of the world:</strong> Satan (the Adversary) offered Jesus immediate political power without the Cross. Jesus chose the path of suffering to achieve true covenantal authority.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>4:17 — Come nigh:</strong> Literally "is at hand." The same urgent deadline John preached. The Kingdom was not a future millennium; it was the immediate replacement of the Old Covenant order.</div>
  <div class="annotation-item"><strong>4:19 — Fishers of men:</strong> A reference to Jeremiah 16:16, where God sends "fishers" to catch Israel for judgment and restoration.</div>
</div>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The True Son Succeeds Where Israel Failed</h3>
<p>
The temptation account is not merely a lesson in "how to resist sin"; it is a covenantal replay of history. Israel, God’s "son" (Exodus 4:23), went into the wilderness and failed three specific tests: appetite (manna), testing God (Massah), and idolatry (Golden Calf). Jesus goes into the wilderness and faces the exact same three tests. By quoting Deuteronomy for every answer, Jesus declares, "I am the obedient Israel." He earns the right to lead the people because He alone has kept the Covenant.
</p>

<h3>2) The Kingdom is Not Postponed</h3>
<p>
In verse 17, Jesus picks up John’s message word-for-word: "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Many theologians argue that because Israel rejected Jesus, this offer was withdrawn and postponed for 2,000+ years. This is false. The King did not say, "The Kingdom is at hand, *if* you accept me." He announced it as an incoming reality that could not be stopped. The Old Order was about to be dismantled, and the New Creation was breaking in.
</p>

<h3>3) Light to the Gentiles (The End of Exclusivity)</h3>
<p>
Jesus begins His ministry in "Galilee of the Gentiles" (v. 15), fulfilling Isaiah 9. This is a strategic geographic signal. Jerusalem and Judea were the centers of Old Covenant exclusion and "darkness." By starting in the mixed, marginalized region of Galilee, Jesus signals that the New Covenant will not be restricted to pure-blood lineage or temple geography. The "Great Light" is for the nations.
</p>

<h3>4) Creating the New Twelve</h3>
<p>
The calling of the disciples is the formation of a new government. Jesus does not consult the Sanhedrin or the Levitical priesthood. He walks to the sea and hand-picks a new leadership structure. By choosing twelve apostles, He is actively reconstituting the Twelve Tribes of Israel around Himself. The old hierarchy is being bypassed; the fishermen are becoming the judges of the New Israel.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
We serve a King who has already passed the test. We do not have to earn our standing before God by surviving a wilderness of our own; we are "in Him," the One who succeeded. Furthermore, the Kingdom He announced is not a future dream—it is the present reality. We live in the "Great Light" that has already dawned, free from the shadows of the Old Age.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Do I trust that Jesus has fully secured my covenant standing through His obedience, or do I secretly feel I need to pass a "wilderness test" to prove I am worthy of God's love?
