<h1>Matthew 24</h1>
<h2>The End of the Old World and the Sign of the Son of Man</h2>

<p class="note">

</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
After pronouncing the "Seven Woes" and leaving the Temple desolate, Jesus’ disciples point out the beauty of the Temple stones. 
Jesus responds with a total shock to their system: the entire edifice will be leveled.
</p>
<p>
This chapter is the <strong>Olivet Discourse</strong>. It answers the questions: <strong>When will the Temple fall, and what is the sign of the completion of the Mosaic Age?</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>The Demolition of the Old Center (24:1–3)</h3>
<p>
As Jesus walked away from the Temple, His disciples pointed to its massive stones. 
Jesus said, "Do you see all these? Truly I say to you, <strong>not one stone will be left on another</strong> that will not be torn down." 
Later, on the Mount of Olives, the disciples asked privately, "When will this happen? What is the sign of Your presence (Parousia) and the completion of the age (Sunteleia)?"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The disciples were asking about the end of the Jewish/Temple Age, not the end of the physical planet.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Birth Pains of the New (24:4–14)</h3>
<p>
"Watch out for deceivers. You will hear of wars, famines, and earthquakes—but the end of the age is not yet. 
These are the beginning of birth pains. You will be persecuted and hated, but do not be afraid. 
The Good News of the Kingdom will be announced to the <strong>entire inhabited world</strong> (Oikoumene) as a testimony to all nations, and then the end of the age will come."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The Apostles confirmed the Gospel reached the "whole world" (the Roman Oikoumene) before AD 70 (Col. 1:23, Rom. 10:18).
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Tribulation of Judea (24:15–28)</h3>
<p>
"When you see the 'abomination of desolation' standing in the holy place, flee to the mountains. 
It will be a time of distress unparalleled in the history of this nation. 
If anyone says, 'Look, here is the Christ,' do not believe it. 
For as lightning flashes across the sky, so will be the presence of the Son of Man. 
<strong>Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles (Roman legions) will gather.</strong>"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> This describes the Roman siege of Jerusalem. The "carcass" was dead Israel; the "eagles" were the Roman standards.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Coming on the Clouds (24:29–31)</h3>
<p>
"Immediately after that tribulation, the sun and moon will be darkened, and the powers of heaven will be shaken. 
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and glory. 
He will send His messengers to gather His chosen from the four winds."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> This is prophetic apocalyptic language for the collapse of a political/religious system (The Jewish State). The "gathering" is the spiritual harvest of the New Covenant.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Generation Deadline (24:32–35)</h3>
<p>
"Learn from the fig tree: when its leaves appear, summer is near. 
Likewise, when you see these things, know it is at the very doors. 
Truly I say to you, <strong>this generation will by no means pass away until all these things take place.</strong> 
The old heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will remain."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> "This generation" always means the contemporaries of the speaker. Every event in Matthew 24 occurred by AD 70.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Watchfulness and Noah (24:36–51)</h3>
<p>
"No one knows the exact day or hour, but it will be like the days of Noah. 
Life went on as usual until the flood swept them away. 
So it will be with the Son of Man: one will be taken (in judgment) and one left (in safety). 
Be like the faithful servant whom the Master finds working when He arrives, not the evil servant who thinks the Master is delayed."
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Sunteleia vs. the Cosmos</h3>
<p>
Most translations use the word "world," but the Greek is <em>Sunteleia</em> (consummation) of the <em>Aion</em> (age). 
Jesus is explaining the end of the Mosaic Age, not the end of the physical globe. 
The "End" came when the Temple fell.
</p>

<h3>2) The Roman Abomination</h3>
<p>
The "abomination of desolation" was the pagan Roman army surrounding the holy city. 
Luke 21:20 explicitly defines this. The Christians followed Jesus’ warning and fled to Pella, 
sparing them from the slaughter that consumed the rest of the city.
</p>

<h3>3) Falling Stars and Dark Suns</h3>
<p>
Jesus uses OT "judgment language" (Isaiah 13, Ezekiel 32). 
In the prophets, stars falling and the sun darkening meant a government was falling. 
This was the poetic description of the death of the Jewish state in AD 70.
</p>

<h3>4) The Generation Stumbling Block</h3>
<p>
Futurists try to make "this generation" mean a future race or a 2,000-year gap. 
However, in Matthew, "this generation" always refers to the people living at that time (Matt 11:16, 12:41, 23:36). 
Jesus was a true prophet; the events happened within 40 years of His speech.
</p>

<h3>5) Heaven and Earth Passing Away</h3>
<p>
In Hebrew thought, the "Heaven and Earth" was a common term for the Temple and the Covenant system. 
When the Temple was destroyed, the "old heavens and earth" passed away, 
leaving only the **Finished Work** of the New Heaven and Earth (the New Covenant).

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 24 teaches us that the "Great Tribulation" is a historical event, not a future fear. 
We do not live in anticipation of a "coming" judgment; we live in the light of the "Finished" victory. 
The "Old Heavens and Earth" are gone. We are the "gathered" ones, living in the permanent, 
unshakeable Kingdom that emerged from the labor pains of the first century.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still looking for signs in the news, or have I realized that the "End of the Age" was fulfilled in AD 70?
</p>
<p>
If the "Old House" is gone, am I fully dwelling in the "New House" of the Finished Work?
</p>
