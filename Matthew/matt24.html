<h1>Matthew 24</h1>
<h2>The Deconstruction of the Old and the Arrival of the New</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Immediate Context</h3>
<p>Jesus has just left the Temple for the final time, pronouncing it "desolate" (23:38). As He sits on the Mount of Olives overlooking Jerusalem, the disciples ask for the "timing" and "signs" of the Temple's destruction and the consummation of the Mosaic Age. This chapter, the Olivet Discourse, provides the blueprint for the transition from the Old Covenant to the New.</p>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <span class="v-num">1</span>And Jesus having gone out, went from the temple, and His disciples came near to show Him the buildings of the temple, <span class="v-num">2</span>and Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these? Truly I say to you, there may not be left here a stone on a stone, that will not be thrown down." <span class="v-num">3</span>And as He is sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came near to Him by themselves, saying, "Tell us, when will these be? And what is the sign of Your presence, and of the completion of the age?" <span class="v-num">4</span>And Jesus answering said to them, "See that no one may lead you astray, <span class="v-num">5</span>for many will come in My Name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray; <span class="v-num">6</span>and you are about to hear of wars and rumors of wars; see, be not troubled, for it is necessary for all these to come to pass, but the end is not yet. <span class="v-num">7</span>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in various places; <span class="v-num">8</span>and all these are the beginning of birth-pains; <span class="v-num">9</span>then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My Name; <span class="v-num">10</span>and then will many be stumbled, and they will deliver up one another, and they will hate one another. <span class="v-num">11</span>And many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray; <span class="v-num">12</span>and because of the abounding of the lawlessness, the love of the many will become cold; <span class="v-num">13</span>but he who has endured to the end—he will be saved; <span class="v-num">14</span>and this Good News of the Kingdom will be proclaimed in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations, and then will the end come. <span class="v-num">15</span>Whenever, therefore, you may see the abomination of the desolation, that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoever is reading let him observe), <span class="v-num">16</span>then those in Judea, let them flee to the mountains; <span class="v-num">17</span>he on the house-top, let him not come down to take anything out of his house; <span class="v-num">18</span>and he in the field, let him not turn back to take his garments. <span class="v-num">19</span>And woe to those with child, and to those giving suck in those days; <span class="v-num">20</span>and pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath; <span class="v-num">21</span>for then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor may ever be. <span class="v-num">22</span>And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would have been saved; but because of the chosen, those days will be shortened. <span class="v-num">23</span>Then if any may say to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! you may not believe it; <span class="v-num">24</span>for there will arise false Christs and false prophets, and they will give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, also the chosen. <span class="v-num">25</span>Behold, I have foretold it to you. <span class="v-num">26</span>If, therefore, they may say to you, Behold, he is in the wilderness, you may not go forth; Behold, in the inner chambers, you may not believe it; <span class="v-num">27</span>for as the lightning comes out from the east, and appears to the west, so will be also the presence of the Son of Man; <span class="v-num">28</span>for wherever the carcass may be, there will the eagles be gathered together. <span class="v-num">29</span>And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; <span class="v-num">30</span>and then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven; and then will all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the heaven with power and much glory; <span class="v-num">31</span>and He will send His messengers with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His chosen from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to their ends. <span class="v-num">32</span>And from the fig tree learn the parable: when its branch may have already become tender, and may put forth the leaves, you know that the summer is near, <span class="v-num">33</span>so also you, when you may see all these, know that it is near—at the doors. <span class="v-num">34</span>Truly I say to you, this generation may by no means pass away until all these may come to pass. <span class="v-num">35</span>The heaven and the earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1. The Two-Part Question</h3>
<p>The disciples ask about (1) when "these things" (the Temple's destruction) would happen and (2) what the sign of His presence and the "end of the age" would be. In the Jewish mind, the destruction of the Temple *was* the end of the age. Jesus answers these questions as a singular historical event. He is not describing the end of the world, but the end of the Old Covenant "world" centered in Jerusalem.</p>

<h3>2. The Sign of the Son of Man</h3>
<p>In verse 30, the "sign of the Son of Man in heaven" is not a physical object in the sky. It is the destruction of Jerusalem itself that serves as the sign. The falling of the Temple was the historical proof that the Son of Man had indeed been enthroned in the heavens. When the earthly throne (the Temple) was destroyed, it revealed the heavenly throne (the Christ) as the true seat of authority.</p>

<h3>3. De-coding Apocalyptic Language</h3>
<p>The darkening of the sun, moon, and stars (v. 29) is standard prophetic imagery for the collapse of political and religious rulers (see Isaiah 13:10 for the fall of Babylon). "Heaven and earth" passing away (v. 35) refers to the Covenantal universe—the Temple and the Law system. When the High Priest's "heavenly" authority and the "earthly" sacrifices ended, that "world" passed away to make room for the unshakeable Kingdom.</p>

<h3>4. The Immutable Deadline</h3>
<p>Jesus provides the definitive time-stamp in verse 34: "This generation will by no means pass away until all these things take place." To push these events into a distant future is to make Jesus a false prophet. "This generation" always refers to the contemporaries of the speaker. Every sign, including the Great Tribulation and the Parousia, was fulfilled within the 40-year window (AD 30-70).</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>We do not live in fear of a future "Great Tribulation." That historical storm has already passed, clearing the way for the New Heaven and New Earth where righteousness dwells. We live in the post-AD 70 reality where the King is fully enthroned and the way to the Father is open without Temple, priest, or sacrifice. The Kingdom is not "coming"; it is here, and it is expanding.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>If Jesus fulfilled every promise of judgment on the Old system exactly when He said He would, how much more can you trust His present-tense promise to be with you until the very completion of your own purpose in His Kingdom?</p>
