<h1>Matthew 27</h1>
<h2>The Final Sacrifice and the Tearing of the Veil</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
The night of betrayal is over. Jesus is handed over to the Roman authorities. 
This chapter records the trial, the mocking, the crucifixion, and the burial. 
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>at the moment of Jesus' death, the barrier of the Law was torn, the tombs of the old world were opened, and the legal center of the universe shifted from the Temple to the Cross.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Judas and the Blood Money (27:1–10)</h3>
<p>
When morning came, the religious leaders led Jesus to Pilate. Judas, seeing He was condemned, was seized with remorse. He tried to return the thirty pieces of silver, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They replied, "What is that to us?" Judas threw the money into the sanctuary and went and hanged himself. The priests took the money and bought the Potter’s Field, fulfilling the prophecy: "They took the thirty pieces of silver... and gave them for the potter's field."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "Blood Money" was used to buy a graveyard for outsiders. Prophetically, the death of Christ "purchased" a place for those who were once dead and excluded from the inheritance.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Trial Before Pilate: The Exchange (27:11–26)</h3>
<p>
Jesus stood before the governor. Pilate asked, "Are You the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "It is as you say." 
At the feast, Pilate offered to release a prisoner. He asked the crowd, "Whom do you want? Barabbas the murderer, or Jesus the Christ?" 
Persuaded by the priests, the crowd shouted, "Barabbas!" 
Pilate asked, "What then shall I do with Jesus?" They screamed, "Crucify Him! <strong>His blood be on us and on our children!</strong>" 
Pilate washed his hands, released the murderer, and handed the King over to be scourged and crucified.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "blood on our children" was the self-pronounced sentence that fell in AD 70. Barabbas (meaning "Son of the Father") was the counterfeit whom the people chose over the True Son.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Mocking of the King (27:27–44)</h3>
<p>
The soldiers stripped Him, put a scarlet robe on Him, and wove a crown of thorns for His head. They spat on Him and mocked Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 
Then they led Him to Golgotha. They crucified Him between two thieves. Passersby mocked Him, "If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!" The priests sneered, "He saved others; Himself He cannot save!"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The crown of thorns represents the "curse" of the ground from Genesis. By wearing the thorns, Jesus was legally absorbing the curse into Himself to remove it from the New Creation.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Finished Cry and the Torn Veil (27:45–54)</h3>
<p>
From the sixth hour to the ninth, darkness covered the land. Jesus cried out, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 
Soon after, He cried out again with a loud voice and <strong>yielded up His spirit.</strong> 
At that moment, the <strong>veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</strong> The earth shook, and rocks were split. 
Tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised. 
The Centurion, seeing these things, said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The tearing of the veil (the <em>Katapetasma</em>) signaled the end of the Old Covenant's "Holy of Holies." Access to God was no longer restricted; the way was now open to all through the Finished Work.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Burial of the King (27:55–66)</h3>
<p>
Joseph of Arimathea, a rich disciple, took the body of Jesus, wrapped it in clean linen, and laid it in his own new tomb. 
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sat opposite the tomb. 
The next day, the priests asked Pilate to secure the tomb, fearing the disciples would steal the body. 
Pilate gave them a guard, and they sealed the stone.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "Seal" of the old world could not hold the Life of the New. The religious leaders' attempt to secure the tomb only served to provide more evidence for the coming Resurrection.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Legal Exchange of Barabbas</h3>
<p>
The release of Barabbas is a perfect picture of the Gospel. 
The guilty man is set free while the Innocent One takes his place. 
This was not an accident of history, but a physical demonstration of the Finished Work: 
the "rebel" is released because the King has stood in his place of judgment.
</p>

<h3>2) The Curse of the Thorns</h3>
<p>
In Genesis, thorns and thistles were the sign of the curse on the earth due to Adam's fall. 
By being crowned with thorns, Jesus was taking the "headship" of that curse. 
When He died, He put an end to the "world of the curse," allowing us to live in a "Blessed" New Creation.
</p>

<h3>3) The End of the Temple Barrier</h3>
<p>
The veil was a thick, woven barrier that separated the Presence of God from the people. 
It was torn <strong>from top to bottom</strong>, showing it was an act of God, not man. 
The Finished Work means there is no longer a "secret place" for priests only; 
every believer is now a priest with direct access to the Father.
</p>

<h3>4) The Opening of the Tombs</h3>
<p>
Matthew alone records the saints being raised at the moment of the Cross. 
This is the "Firstfruits" of the Resurrection. 
It signifies that the death of Christ was so powerful it immediately began to reach back into the "Old World" of death and pull people out. 
It proves that the power of death was legally broken the moment He yielded His spirit.
</p>

<h3>5) The Blood on the Children</h3>
<p>
The "blood on our children" (v. 25) is a heavy historical marker. 
Forty years later (one generation), the very city that demanded His blood saw its own blood shed in the streets of Jerusalem. 
The Finished Work offered them an exit from this judgment, but by clinging to the "Old," they suffered its end.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 27 reveals that the "separation" is over. 
The veil is torn, the curse is worn by the King, and the tombs are open. 
We do not live as people who are "trying to get to God"; we live as people who have been given **total access**. 
The "darkness" of the Old Covenant has passed away at the Cross. 
We are the "Saints" who have been raised to walk in Newness of Life.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still acting like there is a "veil" between me and God, or have I walked through the torn opening into His presence?
</p>
<p>
Do I recognize that the "crown of thorns" Jesus wore has removed the curse from my identity forever?
</p>
