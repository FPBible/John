<h1>Matthew 19</h1>
<h2>Hardness of Heart vs. The Regeneration of All Things</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text: 
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19&version=LSV" target="_blank">Matthew 19 — LSV</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus leaves Galilee and enters the borders of Judea. The Pharisees immediately attempt to trap Him using the Law of Moses. 
Jesus responds by distinguishing between the "concessions" of the Law and the "intent" of the New Creation.
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>the Law was a temporary fix for a hard heart, but the Kingdom is a restoration of the original Union with God.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Marriage and the Original Intent (19:1–12)</h3>
<p>
The Pharisees asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?" 
Jesus didn't point to the scroll of the Law first; He pointed to the Beginning: "Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning made them male and female? 
What God has joined together, let no man separate." 
They countered, "Then why did Moses command a certificate of divorce?" 
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted it because of your <strong>hardness of heart</strong>, but from the beginning it was not so. 
In the New Reality, we return to the original Union." 
The disciples noted that this standard was high; Jesus replied that this life is understood only by those to whom it is given.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The Law of Moses managed sin; the New Covenant removes the "hardness" that made the Law necessary.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Kingdom Belongs to the Simple (19:13–15)</h3>
<p>
People brought little children to Jesus for a blessing. The disciples rebuked them, still thinking in terms of status. 
Jesus said, "Leave the children alone. Do not stop them, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those who are like them."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> You cannot "achieve" the New Creation; you can only receive it with the simple trust of a child.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Rich Young Ruler: Law vs. Life (19:16–26)</h3>
<p>
A man asked, "What good thing shall I do to have eternal life?" 
Jesus pointed him to the commandments. The man claimed he had kept them all. 
Jesus then exposed the root: "If you want to be complete, sell your possessions, give to the poor, and follow Me." 
The man went away grieving because he had great wealth. 
Jesus told His disciples, "It is hard for a rich man to enter the Kingdom. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle." 
The disciples were shocked: "Who then can be saved?" 
Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God <strong>all things are possible.</strong>"
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The man was trying to "buy" the New with the currency of the Old (merit and wealth). Entrance into Life is a work of God, not an accomplishment of man.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Promise of the Regeneration (19:27–30)</h3>
<p>
Peter said, "We have left everything to follow You. What will we have?" 
Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, in the <strong>Regeneration</strong> (the New Creation), when the Son of Man sits on His throne of glory, 
you who followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
Everyone who has left houses or family for My sake will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life. 
But many who are first in the old system will be last in the New, and the last will be first."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "Regeneration" is the New Covenant age. The "judging" of the tribes refers to the apostolic authority that replaced the old Sanhedrin.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Beyond the Hard Heart</h3>
<p>
Jesus defines the Mosaic Law as a temporary management system for "hard hearts." 
In the Finished Work, the "stony heart" has been replaced with a "heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 36). 
Therefore, we don't live by the concessions of the Law, but by the power of a restored life.
</p>

<h3>2) The Eye of the Needle</h3>
<p>
The "impossible" nature of salvation for the rich was a blow to the "Prosperity" theology of the Old Covenant, 
where wealth was seen as a sign of God's favor under the Law. 
Jesus proves that no amount of Old World "blessing" can gain a man entry into the New Creation. 
It requires a total surrender of the old identity.
</p>

<h3>3) The Regeneration (Palingenesia)</h3>
<p>
The word "Regeneration" in verse 28 refers to the "new birth" of the world. 
This is not a far-distant future event; it is the New Covenant era. 
When Jesus sat on His throne (after the Ascension and the destruction of the old Temple), 
 the New World was fully inaugurated.
</p>

<h3>4) The Twelve Thrones</h3>
<p>
The twelve apostles represent the new leadership of the "True Israel." 
Their "judging" is the teaching and authority of the New Testament that now governs the people of God, 
superseding the authority of the physical twelve tribes.
</p>

<h3>5) The First and the Last</h3>
<p>
This is the "Great Reversal." Those who were "first" (the religious elite of the Old Covenant) 
found themselves "last" (outside the Kingdom), while the "last" (sinners, Gentiles, and the poor) 
found themselves "first" in the New Creation.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 19 reveals that we are living in the "Regeneration." 
The barriers of the "hard heart" have been removed by the Finished Work. 
We don't follow Jesus to *get* a reward in the future; we live *from* the hundredfold Life He has already provided. 
Our relationships and our resources are no longer governed by the "rules of divorce" or "rules of wealth," 
but by the original intent of God’s Union with man.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Am I still looking for "rules" to manage my hardness of heart, or have I let the Spirit give me a new heart?
</p>
<p>
Do I trust that "all things are possible" in the New Creation, or am I still trying to squeeze through the needle's eye on my own?
</p>
