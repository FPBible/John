  <h1>Matthew 1</h1>

  <h2>Immediate Context</h2>
  <p>Matthew opens his account by bridging the gap between the Old Covenant expectations and the New Creation reality. He presents the legal and covenantal lineage of Jesus Christ, establishing Him as the legitimate heir to the Davidic throne and the ultimate seed of Abraham, set against the backdrop of the impending transition from the shadows of the Law to the substance of the Gospel.</p>

  <h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>
  <h3>1. The Genesis of the New Heavens and Earth</h3>
  <p>The Greek phrase <i>Biblos geneseos</i> in Matthew 1:1 is a profound theological declaration that extends far beyond a simple introduction to a family tree. It is a deliberate echo of the Greek Septuagint’s rendering of Genesis 2:4 and 5:1. Matthew is effectively announcing a "New Genesis," signaling the official beginning of the transition from the Old Covenant age to the New Creation. In a Full Preterist framework, this is the first legal step in dismantling the "First Adam" world. The genealogy provides proof that the system of the Law has reached its climax in a singular Person. For centuries, Israel was defined by biological lineage, circumcision, and the physical land, but Matthew presents Jesus as the "Last Adam" who sums up and completes the entire history of the Old World. This record identifies the one who would eventually dismantle the shadows of the Law and fully inaugurate the New Creation. By the time the Temple was destroyed in AD 70, the physical records of these genealogies were no longer necessary because the spiritual lineage of the Kingdom had been firmly established. We are no longer defined by the generations of the first Adam, but by the "scroll" of the King. This transition was the essential work of the first century—moving the people of God from a fleshly, biological identification to a spiritual, covenantal one. Once the Messiah arrived, the shadows were legally ready to be dismissed, paving the way for a world where lineage is defined by the Spirit rather than the blood of the fathers.</p>

  <h3>2. The Sabbatical Climax of Human History</h3>
  <p>Matthew’s organization of the lineage into three sets of fourteen generations is a sophisticated theological manifesto. In Hebrew gematria, the name "David" (D-V-D) equals 14. By using this structure, Matthew is declaring that Jesus is the "Thrice-Davidic" King, the ultimate heir to the throne. Furthermore, 3 sets of 14 equal 42 generations, which correlates precisely to the 42 encampments of Israel during their wilderness journey. This suggests that history has finally reached its destination; the wandering of the Old Covenant people is over. From a fulfilled perspective, this numerical arrangement points to a sabbatical completion—the long "week" of the Old Covenant age was reaching its seventh day, leading directly into the eternal rest of the Kingdom established in AD 70. This was the "fullness of time" mentioned in Galatians 4:4—the precise moment when the transition from the elements of the old world to the substance of the new was legally triggered. The structure of this lineage proves that Christ is the climax of Israel's history, the one who would lead the people out of the wilderness of the Law and into the settled rest of the New Creation. This mathematical precision reinforces the idea that the Old Covenant was never intended to be permanent, but was a timed period of tutelage leading directly to the Christ. When the 42nd generation arrived, the "wilderness" period of the Law was legally terminated, and the entrance into the New Creation "Land" began.</p>

  <h3>3. Salvation from the Covenant Curse and Exile</h3>
  <p>The angelic declaration that Jesus would "save His people from their sins" is often misunderstood through modern individualistic lenses. Within its first-century context, this was a specific covenantal promise to Israel. The "sins" in question were the transgressions of the Mosaic Law that had kept Israel in a state of spiritual exile and under the threat of death. The Old Covenant could only identify and multiply sin; it could never truly remove it. Jesus came as the Covenant Representative to fulfill the Law’s requirements and take upon Himself the curse of the Law on behalf of the remnant of Israel. This salvation was not a future-tense event for us today, but a historically completed act for the people of that age. It was inaugurated in Matthew 1, secured at the Cross, and fully consummated at the Parousia in AD 70 when the Law—the "strength of sin"—was legally and physically retired along with the Temple system. Today, we do not live under the threat of the Mosaic curse or in a state of "waiting" for salvation to be finished. We live in the freedom of a salvation that is already finished and applied to the New Creation people. The "sins" that separated God from His people have been dealt with once for all, and the barrier of the Law has been removed forever. We are no longer a people in exile; we are the citizens of a Kingdom that has already been redeemed and settled.</p>

  <h3>4. Immanuel: The End of Localized Presence and Shadow</h3>
  <p>The name "Immanuel" (God with us) signifies the most radical shift in the human relationship with the Divine: the transition from a localized presence in a stone temple to the indwelling presence of God in His people. Full Preterism recognizes that the true "Temple" is no longer a physical building in Jerusalem, but the corporate body of Christ. Matthew 1 introduces the concept that would be fully realized when the physical Temple in Jerusalem fell. The "with us" reality was no longer restricted by veils, human priests, or animal sacrifices. Because Christ fulfilled every shadow, the presence of God is now an immediate, direct, and constant reality for every believer. We live in the "New Jerusalem" where the tabernacle of God is with men. This wasn't a hope for a distant future; it was the entire purpose of Christ's entry into the world. In the New Creation, there is no more "distance" between God and His people, as the Old Covenant barriers have been permanently removed. The arrival of Immanuel meant that the "heaven and earth" of the old system had to pass away to make way for a world where God and man are perfectly reconciled. This reconciliation is not something we are waiting for in a second "coming"—it is the settled state of the New Creation which we currently inhabit. The presence of God is the air we breathe in the Kingdom, and our union with Him is as permanent as the throne of the King who was born in Bethlehem.</p>

  <h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
  <p>The transition is over. You are no longer living under a shadow or a promise—you are living in the fulfillment. Immanuel is not a "future hope" but a present fact. You have been saved from the system of sin and death and brought into the eternal life of the Kingdom. You are no longer defined by your natural lineage or the failures of the "First Adam," but by your union with the King of the New Creation.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Does your walk reflect the reality that "God is with us" now, or are you still living with a "shadow" mentality, searching for a presence that has already arrived?</p>
