<h2>Paraphrase</h2>

<p>
Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city.
They brought to Him a paralyzed man lying on a bed.
Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man,
“Take courage, son. Your sins are forgiven.”
</p>

<p>
Some of the scribes said within themselves,
“This man blasphemes.”
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said,
“Why do you think evil in your hearts?
Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’
or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins…”
Then He said to the paralyzed man,
“Get up, take your bed, and go to your house.”
</p>

<p>
The man got up and went home.
The crowds were afraid and glorified God,
who had given such authority to men.
</p>

<p>
As Jesus passed by, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth.
He said to him, “Follow Me.”
He got up and followed Him.
</p>

<p>
As Jesus reclined at table in the house,
many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw it, they said,
“Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
</p>

<p>
Jesus heard and said,
“Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
Go and learn what this means:
‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’
For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”
</p>

<p>
Then John’s disciples came to Him saying,
“Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said,
“Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them?
The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away,
and then they will fast.”
</p>

<p>
“No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment,
for the patch pulls away and a worse tear results.
Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins.
If they do, the skins burst and the wine is spilled.
But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”
</p>

<p>
While He was saying these things, a synagogue ruler came, bowed down, and said,
“My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.”
Jesus rose and followed him, and so did His disciples.
</p>

<p>
A woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years came behind Him
and touched the fringe of His garment.
She said within herself,
“If I only touch His garment, I will be made well.”
Jesus turned and saw her and said,
“Take courage, daughter. Your faith has made you well.”
And the woman was made well from that hour.
</p>

<p>
When Jesus came to the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd in turmoil,
He said, “Leave, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.”
They laughed at Him.
But when the crowd was put outside, He went in, took her by the hand,
and the girl arose.
And the report went out through that whole region.
</p>

<p>
As Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out,
“Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
When He entered the house, the blind men came to Him.
Jesus said, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”
They said, “Yes, Lord.”
</p>

<p>
Then He touched their eyes, saying,
“According to your faith be it done to you.”
And their eyes were opened.
Jesus strictly warned them, “See that no one knows.”
But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout that land.
</p>

<p>
As they were going out, a mute man oppressed was brought to Him.
When the oppression was driven out, the mute man spoke.
The crowds marveled, saying,
“Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”
</p>

<p>
But the Pharisees said,
“He drives out the spirits by the ruler of the spirits.”
</p>

<p>
Jesus went around all the cities and villages,
teaching in their synagogues,
proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,
and healing every disease and every sickness.
</p>

<p>
When He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them,
because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then He said to His disciples,
“The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest,
that He will send out workers into His harvest.”
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Forgiveness is claimed on earth by the Son of Man — authority shifts from temple-management to Christ.</li>
  <li>“Mercy, not sacrifice” exposes the failure of the Law-system and signals covenant change.</li>
  <li>New wine cannot be carried by old skins — New Covenant life cannot run on Sinai structures.</li>
  <li>Restoration signs (healing, sight, speech, life) mark the kingdom’s present arrival, not a delayed age.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<p>
Matthew 9 is a chapter of collisions — not just miracles.
The clash is between a **temple-shaped, sacrifice-managed world**
and the **direct authority of Christ** bringing the kingdom into lived reality.
</p>

<h3>1) Forgiveness without temple jurisdiction</h3>
<p>
Jesus begins by doing what the religious system considered its territory:
He pronounces forgiveness.
The scribes call it blasphemy because, in their world, forgiveness was tied to
authorized structures — priests, sacrifices, and the temple.
But Jesus answers by proving the point with visible authority:
the same voice that declares forgiveness commands paralysis to leave.
</p>

<p>
This is not Jesus “respecting the system.”
It is Jesus **replacing the system’s claim to mediate access to God**.
That is exactly where “not under law” becomes concrete:
Sinai’s administration cannot remain the governing jurisdiction once Christ is exercising
the authority it only shadowed.
(Framework: <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/end-of-the-law.html">End of the Law</a>)
</p>

<h3>2) Table fellowship: mercy over boundary-markers</h3>
<p>
The calling of Matthew and the meal with “tax collectors and sinners” is not random hospitality.
It is a declaration that purity is not being defined by Law-boundary management anymore.
The Pharisees accuse; Jesus answers with a physician image:
the sick need healing, not exclusion.
</p>

<p>
Then He quotes Hosea: “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.”
That line is not a gentle preference. It is a covenant diagnosis.
Sacrifice had become a substitute for mercy — a system that could manage guilt
without producing love.
Jesus exposes it as spiritually bankrupt and announces what God actually seeks.
</p>

<p>
The New Covenant pattern is clear: **mercy first**, because **life has arrived**.
Love is not an optional extra; it is the governing shape of Spirit-life.
When the apostolic letters later say love “fulfills the law,” they mean the Law’s intended outcome
is reached without reinstating Sinai as the operating jurisdiction
(<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Rom13.8-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 13:8–10</a>;
<a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.8?ref=Bible.Gal5.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatians 5:14</a>).
</p>

<h3>3) Fasting, the Bridegroom, and the end of old-world piety</h3>
<p>
The fasting question reveals a deeper issue: the old world measured devotion by practices that signaled
waiting, mourning, and lack.
Jesus answers by saying the Bridegroom is present.
In other words: the moment has shifted.
You don’t act like the kingdom is absent while the King is standing in front of you.
</p>

<p>
This is not Jesus abolishing prayer or turning discipline into laziness.
It is Jesus announcing that covenant life is no longer defined by “we’re still waiting.”
New Creation faith lives from presence, not from delay-theology.
(See: <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/parousia.html">Parousia</a>)
</p>

<h3>4) New cloth and new wine: you can’t run Christ through Sinai</h3>
<p>
The cloth and wineskin sayings are the interpretive key for the whole chapter.
Jesus is not patching the old system.
He is not “upgrading” Sinai.
He is not adding a Jesus-layer to Moses.
</p>

<p>
New wine in old skins bursts the container.
That’s what happens when you try to take New Covenant realities — union, Spirit-life, mercy-first living —
and cram them back into Law-based frameworks of measurement, fear, and boundary markers.
It leaks out as hypocrisy, burnout, coercion, and accusation.
This is why later movements that claim “New Creation” while rebuilding Sinai are unstable by design.
(Framework: <a href="/Bible/Prophecy/end-of-the-law.html">End of the Law</a>)
</p>

<h3>5) Restoration signs: life breaking into a death-shaped world</h3>
<p>
The ruler’s daughter raised, the woman healed from a long flow of blood, blind eyes opened, and mute speech restored —
these are not merely “power moments.”
They are restoration signs.
They announce that the kingdom is arriving as **life**, **wholeness**, and **deliverance** in the present.
</p>

<p>
In covenant language, “death” includes exclusion, uncleanness, separation, and condemnation.
Jesus reverses those realities openly.
This is why resurrection in the New Testament is not a postponed biology debate.
It is covenant victory moving into lived reality, culminating in the first-century transition
and the objective dismantling of the Law-system’s center in AD 70.
(See: <a href="/Bible/Resurrection/index.html">Resurrection</a>)
</p>

<h3>6) The shepherd problem and the harvest</h3>
<p>
Matthew ends the chapter by showing Jesus’ compassion:
the people are harassed and scattered like sheep without a shepherd.
That is not a comment about “human weakness.”
It is an indictment of leadership that managed law, sacrifice, and control,
while failing to actually shepherd the people into life.
</p>

<p>
So Jesus speaks of harvest and workers.
This is not “church growth strategy.”
It is kingdom mission in a covenant transition —
bringing people out of a collapsing old order and into the life of the kingdom
before judgment completes its work on that system.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>

<p>
Matthew 9 shows what “not under law” looks like on the ground:
forgiveness without temple management,
mercy over sacrifice,
presence over delay,
and Spirit-life expressed as love.
New wine needs a new container — a new covenant people living from Christ, not from Sinai.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do you still treat forgiveness as something mediated by religious performance, or received by Christ’s authority?</li>
  <li>Where have you substituted “sacrifice” (religious doing) for mercy (love in action)?</li>
  <li>What parts of your faith still act like the Bridegroom is absent?</li>
  <li>Where are you trying to pour New Covenant life into old-Sinai thinking?</li>
</ul>
