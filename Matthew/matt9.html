<h1>Matthew 9</h1>
<h2>The New Wineskin and the Authority of the Son of Man</h2>

<p class="note">
Original text:
<a href="https://www.lsvbible.com/" target="_blank">Matthew 9 — LSV</a>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Matthew 9 records the collision between the Old Covenant system and the reality of the New. 
Jesus demonstrates that He is not an "add-on" to the law of Moses, but a complete replacement of the vessel.
</p>
<p>
This chapter establishes that <strong>forgiveness is a present authority, the sacrificial system is obsolete, and the New Wine requires a New Wineskin.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fulfilled Paraphrase</h2>

<h3>Present Authority over Sin (9:1–8)</h3>
<p>
Returning to His own city, some men brought a paralyzed man to Jesus. 
Seeing their faith, He went straight to the Finished Work: "Take courage, child; your sins have been forgiven you." 
The scribes accused Him of blasphemy, clinging to the idea that sin was only handled through the Temple.
</p>
<p>
Jesus challenged them: "Which is easier? To say, 'Sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? 
But that you may know the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive—stand up, take your bed, and go home." 
The man stood and left. The crowd was awestruck that such authority was now present in the realm of men.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> Forgiveness is no longer a future hope or a ritual shadow; it is a present reality in the Son of Man.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Mercy replaces Sacrifice (9:9–13)</h3>
<p>
Jesus called Matthew, a tax collector, to follow Him. 
While eating with "sinners" at Matthew’s house, the Pharisees questioned His associations. 
Jesus told them, "The healthy don't need a doctor, but the sick do. 
Go learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' 
I didn't come to patch up the 'righteous,' but to call sinners to a New Reality."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The era of "Sacrifice" (the Law) is ending; the era of "Mercy" (the Finished Work) has arrived.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Incompatibility of Covenants (9:14–17)</h3>
<p>
John’s disciples asked why Jesus’ followers didn't practice the fasts of the old order. 
Jesus replied, "You don't mourn while the Bridegroom is present." 
He then used the analogy of the Wineskins: "You don't put a new patch on an old garment, 
nor New Wine into old, brittle wineskins. Both would be ruined. 
New Wine requires a New Wineskin."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The New Covenant cannot be squeezed into the Old Law system. It requires a brand-new foundation.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Life Overcoming the Law's Barriers (9:18–26)</h3>
<p>
A ruler pleaded for his deceased daughter. On the way, a woman who had suffered a 12-year hemorrhage—a symbol of ritual death—touched His garment. 
"Daughter, your faith has made you whole," He said. 
Reaching the ruler's house, He dismissed the mourners and took the girl by the hand. She stood up.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The Law defined blood and death as uncleanness; Jesus reveals them as the footstool of His Life.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Prophetic Sight and Speech (9:27–34)</h3>
<p>
Two blind men followed Him, crying for mercy. Jesus asked, "Do you believe I am able?" 
When they said yes, He touched their eyes: "According to your faith, let it be." Their sight was restored. 
He then cast out a demon from a mute man. 
The crowd marveled, but the Pharisees, trapped in the "Old Wineskin," could only see darkness.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The restoration of sight and speech is the historical sign that the Kingdom of the New Creation is active.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Harvest of the Transition (9:35–38)</h3>
<p>
Jesus traveled everywhere, teaching the Good News and healing every disease. 
He saw the people were exhausted and scattered—sheep without a shepherd under the Law. 
"The harvest is massive," He said, "but the workers are few. Pray for workers for this field."
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Fulfillment note:</strong> The "harvest" is the gathering of souls out of the dying Old Covenant and into the rest of the New.
</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) Forgiveness Bypass</h3>
<p>
By forgiving the paralytic before any sacrifice was offered at the Temple, 
Jesus legally bypassed the Levitical system. 
He established that the Son of Man is the new "place" of atonement, rendering the building obsolete.
</p>

<h3>2) Mercy as the New Operating System</h3>
<p>
"I desire mercy, not sacrifice" is the manifesto of the Finished Work. 
The Law was a system of performance and sacrifice. 
The New Covenant is a system of receiving what has already been given.
</p>

<h3>3) The Death of the Old Vessel</h3>
<p>
Jesus' "Wineskin" teaching is a warning against "mixing" the covenants. 
Those who try to add Grace to the Law (patching the old garment) will find that the pressure of the New Wine (the Spirit) 
eventually shatters the old structures of religious performance.
</p>

<h3>4) The 12-Year Significance</h3>
<p>
The 12-year-old girl and the woman with the 12-year illness represent the "completion" of Israel's time under the Law. 
The "bleeding" and the "dying" of the old nation are meeting their end in the resurrection power of the Son.
</p>

<h3>5) The Pharisees as the Old Wineskin</h3>
<p>
The Pharisees' inability to see God in Jesus (v. 34) proves His point: 
the "Old Wineskin" is not just outdated; it is spiritually blind to the transition. 
It eventually attributes the Spirit's work to the devil.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
Matthew 9 reveals that the Finished Work is an entirely New Creation. 
We do not mourn to get God’s attention; we celebrate because the Bridegroom is here. 
Our mind is the "New Wineskin" that holds the New Wine of the Spirit, 
allowing us to live from Forgiveness as a finished fact.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Where am I still trying to "patch" my old religious habits with New Covenant grace?
</p>
<p>
Do I see the "exhausted sheep" around me as people who need more Law, or as people who need the Rest of the Shepherd?
</p>
