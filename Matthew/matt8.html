<h1>Matthew 8</h1>
<h2>Authority Over All</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Immediate Context</h2>
<p>
Jesus descends from the mountain, moving from the Authority of Word (The Sermon) to the Authority of Deed (Miracles). Matthew groups these miracles to show that the King has jurisdiction over everything the Old Covenant could not fix: leprosy (defilement), Gentile distance, sickness, nature's chaos, and demonic possession. The defining moment is the encounter with the Centurion, foreshadowing the massive covenantal shift from Jewish lineage to Gentile faith.

<h2>Scripture (LSV)</h2>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">1</span> And when he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him,
    <span class="v-num">2</span> and lo, a leper having come, was bowing to him, saying, “Lord, if thou be willing, thou art able to cleanse me.”
    <span class="v-num">3</span> And having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him, saying, “I will; be thou cleansed!” and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
    <span class="v-num">4</span> And Jesus saith to him, “See, thou mayest tell no one, but go, show thyself to the priest, and bring the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">5</span> And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion calling upon him,
    <span class="v-num">6</span> and saying, “Lord, my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic, fearfully tormented.”
    <span class="v-num">7</span> And Jesus saith to him, “I, having come, will heal him.”
    <span class="v-num">8</span> And the centurion answering said, “Lord, I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my young man shall be healed;
    <span class="v-num">9</span> for I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Be coming, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">10</span> And Jesus having heard, did wonder, and said to those following, “Verily I say to you, not even in Israel so great faith have I found;
    <span class="v-num">11</span> and I say to you, that many from east and west shall come and recline (at meat) with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens,
    <span class="v-num">12</span> but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth to the outer darkness—there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.”
    <span class="v-num">13</span> And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go forth, and as thou didst believe let it be to thee;” and his young man was healed in that hour.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">14</span> And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law laid, and fevered,
    <span class="v-num">15</span> and he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose, and was ministering to them.
    <span class="v-num">16</span> And evening having come, they brought to him many demoniacs, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and did heal all who were ill,
    <span class="v-num">17</span> that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “Himself took our infirmities, and the sicknesses he bore.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">18</span> And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him, did command to depart to the other side;
    <span class="v-num">19</span> and a certain scribe having come, said to him, “Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go.”
    <span class="v-num">20</span> And Jesus saith to him, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not where he may recline the head.”
    <span class="v-num">21</span> And another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, suffer me first to go and to bury my father.”
    <span class="v-num">22</span> And Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and suffer the dead to bury their own dead.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">23</span> And he having entered into the boat, his disciples followed him,
    <span class="v-num">24</span> and lo, a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves, but he was sleeping.
    <span class="v-num">25</span> And his disciples having come to him, awoke him, saying, “Lord, save us, we perish.”
    <span class="v-num">26</span> And he saith to them, “Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?” Then having risen, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
    <span class="v-num">27</span> And the men wondered, saying, “What kind—is this, that even the winds and the sea do obey him?”
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="v-num">28</span> And he having come to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming forth out of the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass over that way,
    <span class="v-num">29</span> and lo, they cried out, saying, “What to us and to thee, Jesus, Son of God? Didst thou come hither before the time to afflict us?”
    <span class="v-num">30</span> And there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding,
    <span class="v-num">31</span> and the demons were calling on him, saying, “If thou dost cast us forth, suffer us to go away to the herd of the swine.”
    <span class="v-num">32</span> And he said to them, “Go.” And they having come forth, went away to the herd of the swine, and lo, the whole herd of the swine rushed down the steep to the sea, and died in the waters.
    <span class="v-num">33</span> And those feeding did flee, and having gone to the city, they declared all things, and the matter of the demoniacs.
    <span class="v-num">34</span> And lo, all the city came forth to meet Jesus, and having seen him, they called on [him] that he might depart from their borders.

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1) The Great Replacement</h3>
<p>
The encounter with the Centurion (vv. 5-13) is one of the most shocking texts in Matthew. Jesus declares that the "Sons of the Kingdom"—the natural descendants of Abraham who expected to rule—are going to be thrown into "outer darkness." Meanwhile, Gentiles (represented by the Roman Centurion) will come from the nations and take their seats at the table. This is the "Times of the Gentiles" beginning to dawn. The "weeping and gnashing of teeth" describes the anguish of National Israel realizing they have been excluded from their own promise due to unbelief, a reality that culminated in the siege of Jerusalem.
</p>

<h3>2) Cleansing the Untouchable</h3>
<p>
By touching the leper (v. 3), Jesus violates the Levitical Law (Leviticus 5) which says touching uncleanness makes you unclean. But instead of Jesus becoming defiled, the leper becomes clean. This signals the end of the "contagion" of the Law. In the New Covenant, holiness is more contagious than sin. The King does not need to avoid the world to stay holy; He touches the world to make <em>it</em> holy.
</p>

<h3>3) Torment "Before the Time"</h3>
<p>
The demons in Gadara ask, "Did you come to torment us <em>before the time</em>?" (v. 29). This implies a known, scheduled deadline for the defeat of evil. They knew the "End of the Age" was coming, but the presence of Jesus signaled that the judgment was starting early. The King had arrived to plunder the strong man's house. Casting them into the swine (unclean animals) and then into the sea (the abyss/chaos) was a visual enactment of what the Gospel was about to do to the demonic powers governing the pagan nations.
</p>

<h3>4) No Place to Lay His Head</h3>
<p>
Jesus tells the scribe, "The Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head" (v. 20). This was literally true, but also covenantally significant. The Temple was God's "house," but it had become a den of thieves. The Creator was homeless in His own creation because the Old Covenant structures rejected Him. He was building a new dwelling place—not made of stone, but of people.

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>
We are the "many" who have come from the east and west. We sit at the table that the "Sons of the Kingdom" forfeited. The authority Jesus demonstrated over sickness, storms, and demons has been given to His body, the Church. We do not fear the storm, because the One who sleeps in the boat has already conquered the chaos.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Do I have the faith of the Centurion, who understood that Jesus' word alone was enough to change reality, or do I still demand "signs and wonders" to feel secure?
