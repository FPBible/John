<h1>Matthew 25</h1>
<h2>The Crisis of the Transition and the Sorting of the Generation</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Immediate Context</h3>
<p>Continuing the Olivet Discourse from the previous chapter, Jesus provides three parables to illustrate the internal state and the judicial outcome of those living in the final days of the Mosaic Age. These are not descriptions of a distant "end of the world," but of the "end of the age" separation that occurred as the Old Covenant house was demolished and the New Covenant house was finalized.</p>

<div class="scripture-text">
  <span class="v-num">1</span>"Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be likened to ten virgins, who, having taken their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom; <span class="v-num">2</span>and five of them were prudent, and five foolish; <span class="v-num">3</span>those who were foolish, having taken their lamps, took no oil with themselves; <span class="v-num">4</span>and the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps. <span class="v-num">5</span>And the bridegroom delaying, they all nodded and were sleeping, <span class="v-num">6</span>and at midnight a cry has come, Behold, the bridegroom comes, go forth to meet him. <span class="v-num">7</span>Then all those virgins rose, and trimmed their lamps; <span class="v-num">8</span>and the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil, because our lamps are going out; <span class="v-num">9</span>and the prudent answered, saying—Lest there may not be sufficient for us and you, go rather to those selling, and buy for yourselves. <span class="v-num">10</span>And while they are going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those ready went in with him to the marriage-feasts, and the door was shut; <span class="v-num">11</span>and afterward come also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, lord, open to us; <span class="v-num">12</span>and he answering said, Truly I say to you, I have not known you. <span class="v-num">13</span>Watch therefore, because you have not known the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man comes. <span class="v-num">14</span>For—as a man going abroad called his own servants, and delivered to them his substance, <span class="v-num">15</span>and to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability, and immediately went abroad. <span class="v-num">16</span>And he who received the five talents, having gone, wrought with them, and made other five talents; <span class="v-num">17</span>in like manner also he who received the two, he also gained other two; <span class="v-num">18</span>and he who received the one, having gone, digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money. <span class="v-num">19</span>And after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and takes account with them; <span class="v-num">20</span>and he who received the five talents having come, brought other five talents, saying, Lord, five talents you delivered to me; behold, other five talents I gained besides them. <span class="v-num">21</span>And his lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant, over a few things you were faithful, over many things I will set you; enter into the joy of your lord. <span class="v-num">22</span>And he also who received the two talents having come, said, Lord, two talents you delivered to me; behold, other two talents I gained besides them. <span class="v-num">23</span>His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant, over a few things you were faithful, over many things I will set you; enter into the joy of your lord. <span class="v-num">24</span>And he also who had received the one talent having come, said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering from whence you did not scatter; <span class="v-num">25</span>and having been afraid, having gone, I hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have your own. <span class="v-num">26</span>And his lord answering said to him, Evil and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather from whence I did not scatter? <span class="v-num">27</span>It behoved you then to put my money to the exchangers, and having come I had received my own with increase. <span class="v-num">28</span>Take therefore from him the talent, and give to him having the ten talents, <span class="v-num">29</span>for to everyone having shall be given, and he shall have overabundance, and from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him; <span class="v-num">30</span>and the unprofitable servant cast forth into the outer darkness; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth. <span class="v-num">31</span>And when the Son of Man may come in His glory, and all the holy messengers with Him, then He will sit on a throne of His glory; <span class="v-num">32</span>and gathered together before Him shall be all the nations, and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, <span class="v-num">33</span>and He will set the sheep indeed on His right hand, and the goats on the left. <span class="v-num">34</span>Then will the King say to those on His right hand, Come, you the blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; <span class="v-num">35</span>for I hungered, and you gave Me to eat; I thirsted, and you gave Me to drink; I was a stranger, and you received Me; <span class="v-num">36</span>naked, and you clothed Me; I was infirm, and you looked after Me; in prison I was, and you came to Me. <span class="v-num">37</span>Then will the righteous answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungering, and we fed? Or thirsting, and we gave to drink? <span class="v-num">38</span>And when did we see You a stranger, and we received? Or naked, and we clothed? <span class="v-num">39</span>And when did we see You infirm, or in prison, and we came to You? <span class="v-num">40</span>And the King answering will say to them, Truly I say to you, in as far as you did it to one of these My brothers—the least—to Me you did it. <span class="v-num">41</span>Then will He say also to those on the left hand, Go from Me, the cursed, into the fire the age-abiding, prepared for the Devil and his messengers; <span class="v-num">42</span>for I hungered, and you did not give Me to eat; I thirsted, and you did not give Me to drink; <span class="v-num">43</span>a stranger I was, and you did not receive Me; naked, and you did not clothe Me; infirm, and in prison, and you did not look after Me. <span class="v-num">44</span>Then will they answer Him, they also, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or infirm, or in prison, and we did not minister to You? <span class="v-num">45</span>Then will He answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, in as far as you did it not to one of these the least, neither to Me did you do it. <span class="v-num">46</span>And these will go away into age-abiding punishment, but the righteous into age-abiding life."

<h2>Fulfillment Commentary</h2>

<h3>1. The Ten Virgins and the Midnight Cry</h3>
<p>This parable addresses the first-century expectation. The "delay" (v. 5) tested the endurance of the believers. The "midnight cry" was the onset of the Jewish-Roman war. Those who had the "oil" of the Spirit remained vigilant and fled Jerusalem as commanded, while those relying on the external "lamps" of the Temple rituals found their light extinguished when the "door" of the Mosaic Age was shut in AD 70.</p>

<h3>2. The Talents and the Burial of Grace</h3>
<p>The "man going abroad" is Christ ascending to the Father. He left His "substance" (the Gospel/Holy Spirit) with His servants. The third servant "digged in the earth" (v. 18) to hide the money—a picture of those who tried to keep the New Covenant grace buried within the "earthly" shadows of Judaism. The "taking account" occurred when Christ returned to dismantle the old economy, rewarding those who expanded the Kingdom and casting out those who clung to the "buried" past.</p>

<h3>3. The Separation of Sheep and Goats</h3>
<p>This is not a general judgment at the end of time, but a "Covenantal Sorting." The "nations" (ethne) were the people groups within the Roman world. The criteria for judgment was how they treated "these My brothers—the least" (v. 40). In context, the "brothers" were the Apostles and early Christians (Matt 10:40-42) who were being persecuted and imprisoned. How the nations responded to the Gospel messengers determined their standing in the new age.</p>

<h3>4. The Throne of His Glory</h3>
<p>Jesus promised in Matthew 16:28 that some standing there would see Him coming in His Kingdom. Matthew 25:31 records that coming. Since the Temple’s fall in AD 70, Christ has been seated on His throne. We are not waiting for a throne to be set up; we are living in the reality of a King who has already separated the sheep from the goats and inaugurated the "Age-Abiding Life."</p>

<h2>New Creation Reality</h2>
<p>We do not live in the anxiety of the "foolish virgins" or the "lazy servant." We are the beneficiaries of the "Age-Abiding Life" that Christ secured. The door of the Kingdom is open to us, and we are seated with Him in heavenly places. Our focus is not on avoiding a future fire, but on investing the "talents" of Grace—the life, love, and power of the Spirit—into the world around us because we already inhabit the Joy of our Lord.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Are you still trying to "buy oil" from old religious systems that were shut in AD 70, or are you resting in the overabundance of the Spirit provided by the King who is already on His throne?</p>
